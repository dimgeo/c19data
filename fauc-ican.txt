Subject: Rapid instrument-free NAATfor COVlD-19
DearTony,

In addition to my role as a Stanford Medical School professor, I am the Chief Medical Officer of
Visby Medical, a relativeiy new Silicon Valiey diagnostics company focused on rapid detection of
infectious agents. Visby Medical has developed a rapid (”25 min sample-to-answer) palm-sized,
40 cycle PCR (or RT-PCR) single—use device that does not require an instrument; it is used once,

and then disnarded or recycled- —
—
—
_ The

device is stable at room temperature for up to two years and thus it could be deployed widely.

NIH Production to ICAN_000006 ””0018"

We are seriously considering using this platform to develop a rapid test to detect COVID—19.
Proof of principles that have been achieved toward that end are our demonstration that the
device can use two-step RT-PCR to detect influenza A and B in NP swab samples. The main
features ofthe device are described in the brief accompanying PDF.

I write now because we are unsure, if we were to produce a COVlD-19 device, how it would be
deployed, by whom it would be used and who might be willingto purchase it, I would be very
grateful if you might be able to speak briefly with me and my colleagues about these open
questions. I am convinced this device can meet a major unmet need in clinical care and disease
control forthis epidemic and we, as a group, want to make a difference. Vour advice would be
invaluable as we weigh the risks and benefits of pivoting the companyto this application.

With all best wishes; I hope all is well with you and your family
gary

I am very distressed by the Face of the WHO. Their public face, their news updates. are of the quality of

They need a world class public relations firm.

I am deeply concerned re Covid—19 in India (with a population of 1500 million) and Africa (population
100 million). News reports do not mention anything of this pandemic waiting to happen.

Hope that you are well and getting a good night's rest.

Subject: for review: proposed responses for Italian media request

 

Dr. Fauci —

This is not urgent for today. A reporter from the Italian health website Pazienti.it reached out to you
directly with questions about coronavirus vaccine development. l have drafted proposed responses for
your review attached and pasted below. I will send the final responses to the reporter attributed to you.
Coronavirus vaccine: when will it be available? What are the difficulties?

The National Institutes of Health is on track to testan experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in a
Phase 1 clinical trial this spring. This first phase of clinical testing will involve giving the vaccine to
healthy adults in the United States to see if it is safe and if it can induce an immune response in
recipients. it is important to realize that the development of investigational vaccines and the clinical
testing to establish their safety and effectiveness takes time. A vaccine against the novel coronavirus will
likely not be widely available for at least a year.

NIH Production to ICAN_000016 "“0015“

Could the Coronavirus mutate, if a vaccine cannot be found in time?

We are learning more about the novel coronavirus every day, At thls time, we are not aware of any
mutations that might affect vaccine development. Based on our experience with other coronaviruses,
including SARSrCoV and MERSrCoV, it is unlikelyibut not impossibleithat the novel coronavirus will
mutate in a way that would have an impact on the development of medical countermeasures We are
continuing to monitor this,

Will the vaccine be the solution against Coronavirus?

A safe and effective vaccine would be an extremely valuable tool to help stop the spread of infection
and prevent future outbreaks. However, proven public health practices of identifying cases, isolating
patients, and tracing contacts must continue alongside a vaccination program

Subject: RE: Institutional request for information
Dear Dr. Fried,
Answers to your questions are below.

1. Is the CDC or NIH overseeing the distribution of the live virus in the U.S.?
There is an interagency working group convened by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and
Response overseeing samples, and NIH and CDC are central to this, Virus is being deposited in BEI
Resources (a NlAlD contract resource) for characterization, growth and distribution. The WA isolate
is available now and a Hong Kong isolate may be added soon.

2. Will you be the sole source of distribution in the U.S., or will institutions be permitted to obtain it
directly from other sources?
Assuming appropriate permits are in place, there is no limitation on an institution obtaining samples
directly from BEI or other sources. In a public health emergency, the US. government Seeks to make
isolates available under a Simple Letter Agreement that does not impose IP restrictions on
academics or developers (see attached language).

3. If it can be obtained from other sources, what sources will be permitted? For example, the China
or Hong Kong CDC or University 0! Hong Kong?
Assuming appropriate permits and safety controls, there is no limitation on from where samples can
be obtained. However, there may be intellectual property restrictions from some sources and your
technology transfer ofﬁce would need to negotiate if requested directly.

4. If you are to be the sole source, when would you expect to have a process for considering
requests?
BEI resources already has a process for sharing in place and is currently sharing the Viral isolate
obtained from the first Washington case. NIAiD anticipates that other viral isolates will be obtained
soon, and BEI is committed to making those available to the scientific community as soon as

NIH Production to ICAN_000023 ”“001397

possible, We (NIAID/ USG) do not expect to be the only source, but will likely be one of the main
sources for this research resource based on experience with like.

5. If someone wishes to travel to China to work on the live virus, are there any travel restrictions other
than the self isolation/quarantine already in place (and of course subject to change over time)?
For that, contacting CDC directly would make sense. If you would like us to inquire, we can. For high
consequence viruses, use of proper PPE has been a mitigating factor in quarantine consideration.

Please feel free to contact me ifyou have additional questions.

Thanks,
Alan

Linda:

There is a "sample sharing” working group involving NIH and CDC. I have
copied both Hilary Marston and Alan Embry from NIAID who are involved in this
group and will ask them by this e-mail to respond to items #1 through 4.
Regarding returning travelers from China (item #5) if in Wuhan (Hubei province)
within previous 14 days, they submit to institutional quarantine; if in non-Hubei
province part of China, then they face self—isolation.

Hope that this is helpful.

Dear Drs. Redfield and Fauci,

I am wrltlng on behalf of Columbla Unlversity, whlch has received a request from Dr. Ian Lipkln to
transfer live novel coronaVIrus from Hong Kong to his BSL3 facility at the University. As we evaluate his
request, we note that he hasapproval from a CDC official to import the virus (see attached). However,
as we consider the risks and benefits of Dr. Lipkin‘s proposal, we ask the two of you:

1. Is the CDC or NIH overseeing the distribution of the live virus in the U.S.?

2. Will you be the sole source of distribution in the U.S., or will institutions be permitted to obtain
it directly from other sources?

3. If it can be obtained from other sources, what sources will be permitted? For example, the
China or Hong Kong CDC or University of Hong Kong?

4. If you are to be the sole source, when would you expect to have a process for considering
requests?

5. If someone wishes to travel to China to work on the live virus, are there any travel restrictions
other than the self isolation/quarantine already in place (and of course subject to change over
time)?

Thank you very much for your help with these important questions as we all try to do our best to
contribute solutions to this health crisis.

ABOUT FIRING LINE W|TH MARGARET HOOVER

Firing Line with Margaret Hoover is a refreshing reprisal of William F. Buckley’s iconic PBS
program, a smart. civil and engaging contest of ideas. The series maintains the character of the
original, providing a platform that is diligent in its commitment to civility and the rigorous
exchange of opinion. Firing Line with Margaret Hoover comes at a time when meaningful
discourse IS needed more than ever. InterVIews and debates will highlight leading lights from
the left and right, complemented by archival footage from the original Firing Line to remind
viewers of longstanding conservative and liberal arguments, where they’ve been disproved or
reinforced over time. It is an opportunity to engage in the debate about the America that we
want to create for the let century — and summon Americans of every political persuasion to a
rigorous examination of the choices we must make together in the challenging years ahead.
Showrunner is Emmy, Dupont and Murrow-winning producer Alyssa Litoff.

ABOUT MARGARET HOOVER
Margaret Hoover is an American political commentator. In addition, she is also an author,
feminist, and gay rights activist. Currently, she works as a political commentator for CNN.

I am writing on behalf of Columbia University, which has received a request from Dr. Ian Lipkin to
transfer live novel coronavirus from Hong Kong to his B$L3 facility at the University. As we evaluate his
request, we note that he has approval from a CDC official to import the virus [see attached) However,
as we consider the risks and benefits of Dr. Lipkin‘s proposal, we ask the two of you:

1. Is the CDC or NIH overseeing the distribution of the live virus in the U.S.?

2. Will you be the sole source of distribution in the US, or will institutions be permitted to obtain
it directly from other sources?

3. If it can be obtained from other sources, what sources will be permitted? For example, the
China or Hong Kong CDC or University of Hong Kong?

4. If you are to be the sole source, when would you expect to have a process for considering
requests?

NIH Production to ICAN_000039 "mung";

5‘ If someone wishes to travel to China to work on the live virus, are there any travel restrictions
other than the self isolation/quarantine already in place (and of course subject to change over
time)?

Thank you very much for your help with these important questions as we all try to do our best to
contribute solutions to this health crisis.

With best regards.

Hi Drl Faucl: I saw that you spoke about the lack of major

James's story has to do with a hiosecurity initiative related to
these types of threats at GSK that was started in 2016 and quickly
put on the back burnerr I don't know whether you‘d want to comment
on the company or its activities itself, but would be helpful if

Hi Dr. Fauci: How are you? I'm writing to see
whether we can talk again for a few minutes.
We're working on a biggish piece about the
larger bio-security issue worldwide and what the
coronavirus outbreak tells us about it. What can
we do about the weakest links in disease control
in poorer nations in Africa, Asia and elsewhere?
The WHO today brought up the importance of
access to health care along with spending on
public health, and clearly this is an issue in
poor counties. Is it also important in
infectious disease in the US and if so, is it
adequately recognized? Companies and research
centers have made huge strides in quick
development of vaccines and drugs; what can take
it to the next level? Is there anything that
could be done to attract more companies to this
field? What kind of new technologies can help us
track new viruses in the community? I've been
talking with people using handheld nanopore
sequencers to track coronavirus and Ebola; what
else is out there? Do we need to do a better job
of tracking the movement of people and goods?
Also glad to get any other observations. Please
give me a call today or tomorrow morning at
— or let me know when and at what
number to call you. Thanks and regards, look
forward to hearing from you, JL

Dr. Fauci,

I wanted to reach out to soc if epiqar (https://cpigar.com/) can help your efforts with tho
Coronavirus- we are the only system in the world built for remote surgical help & interactive
emergency surgeon support over the web browser.

epiqar has created the most advanced surgical video collaboration technology, allowing
surgeons to consult and train remotely on a low-cost and easy~to-use online surgical
collaboration platform and CIoud-archivtng system built for the operating room. With the
outbreak of Coronavtrus, this has become more Vital as surgeon mobility and access to critical
surgical spaces in need of more help are severely limited, and specialists Will not risk entering
spreading viral hot zones.

Patient care isn’t just a concern with the virus itself, but with the host of medical issues facing
patients that will no longer be treated by local specialists easily. and facing caregivers: surgeon
involvement from around the world is needed urgently.

Although epiqar is an American company, our rollout in recent months has been in

France, making selected French institutions the most prepared in the world for remote video
care. We obvrously weren't anticipating the Coronavirus and now we're dedicated to delivering
our technology to where the world needs it asap.

epiqar’s parent company ENGAUGE (httgszllengusl) is a state-of—the-art online healthcare
company for surgeon training and has served clients such as Johnson & Johnson, Intuitive
Surgical, and many other oi the world largest & smallest medical devtce companies.
ENGAUGE has helped surgeons all over the world have access to secure online training that
has improved their understanding of the innovations in robotics and many of the latest surgical
techniques and medical devtces for best patient care.

I've linked a whitepaper below with details of the system’s use. Please let me know if you would
like to speak further and/or need anything additional.

My name is Sara Berg and I am a senior writer for the AMA lam reaching out to you today because you
have shared a lot of great information about COVlD—IS with the JAMA network. I know you are very
busy. but I was wondering if you would be available tomorrow orThursday for a quick phone interview

physicians about what to tell patients. The CDC has a list of preventive steps:

https: /www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ZOISVncov hcp/guidancepreventispreadhtml.

ThlS would be what physicians should tell patients who suspect they have COVlD-19. One tip might be
“Call before you come in.” Do you think this is something you would be available to participate in?

I look forward to hearing from you.

INFECTION CONTROL

The ongOing outbreak of the novel coronavirus will raise
questions about how to limit the spread of respiratory
infections.

 

Managing this situation is similar to outbreaks of SARS and
NERS. . .since coronaviruses are spread by respiratory secretions.

Put the risk in perspective to calm worried
patients...s;n:e it doesn't cone close tc the risk of influenza.

For example, over 35 MTTiTiTON [1.9. patients got the flu last
season. . .with about 500,000 hospitalizations and 34,000 deaths.

Emphasize getting a flu vaccine each year.

And use this coronavirus outbreak as an opportunity to
stress infection control...since there’s no treatment or vaccine
yet.

Reinforce proper hand hygiene. Educate that handwashing
with soap and water is the best way to get rid of germs. Advise
washing for 20 seconds...about the tine it takes to sing the ABC
song.

3r recommeno using a hand sanitizer with at least 60%
alcohol if handwashing isn't practiz‘ai. Many products Contain
this much.

But tell patients to be wary of efficacy claims. For
example, hand sanitizers are shown to kill enve;oped viruses.
Coronav;ruses are enve;oped viruses...but they aren’t
specifically studied.

NIH Production to ICAN_000068

Tell patients to avoic touching their eyes, nose, and
mouth.

Clear up confusion about masks. Emphasize that masks are
for SICK pat;ents ..to help keep their qerns from qettinq into
the air.

But discourage surgical masks for most patients withOUT
synptcms...there's no evidence they help. They’re too loose to
limit inhaling germs...and viruses can also get in thraugh the
eyes.

If patients ask about N95 respirators, tell them these
require fitt;ng and training before use. Save than for
healthcare workers.

Caution that unnecessary mask use may contribute to
shortages.

Continue to ask patients WITH respiratory symptoms to put a
surgica; mask an when they come to Clinic.

And suggest that sick patients wear a mask at home if in
close contact with infants, elderly, or immunocompronised
patients.

fell patients to discard masks when camp. ..and to use a
fresh one at least daiLy.

Encourage patients to stay home when they’re sick.

Dear Tony,

ldont mean to bother you, but I have a suggestion, in case you have not
considered it.

China will have hundreds ofthousands of CoronaVirus survivors. Their convalescent
(immune) serum is valuable. China should try to collect it and give it as a goodwill
gesture to people around the world.

For moderately to seriously ill people, Immune serum should save many lives,

if cases start to come here, we also should collect serum from survivors, but
hopefully we will be very late in the pandemic, and it is not needed because of all
of the others things you are doing.

Thankvou for everything you and NlAlD are doing!

Best wishes, Marty

(Just as in SARS, the R0 for nC072019 is higher in hospitals than in the community,
but it still is too high in the community).

Dear Tony,

Thanks for your JAMA piece on 2019-nCoV. Perhaps I can help in a
small way:

In 2003, with SARS, the R0 was initially considered to be over 2, but in
fact that was the conﬂation of the nosocomial and community rates. In the
2004 paper, we showed that nosocomial rate was much higher, and that the
R0 in the community was between 1 and 2. A lower R0 in the community
accounts for why moderate public health actions could move it toward
extinction--and why it propagated in Beijing, but not Shanghai, in Toronto

NIH Production to ICAN_000077 ”“001957

but not in Vancouver--the R0 in North America became less than
one pretty quickly.

To me, one important aspect is the control of respiratory transmission in
the hospital, avoiding extensive nebulization/aerosolization, or doing so in
negative pressure rooms, as for TB isolation,

(Treating patients with robots is a good idea!)

in the community, standard public health quarantine, contact tracing should
be sufﬁcient for starters.

Although hundreds ofcascs are reported in China, the actual number of
infections is likely much higher. The 4l deaths are the tip of the iceberg of
not 800 infections (5% fatality rate), but maybe 8,000 infections (0.5%).
Although that rate is much better. ifthe mutating virus becomes very
contagiousithen the impact could be similar to 1918 ﬂu. That‘s why
containment is so importantiiand although draconian, the Chinese
government is doing the right thing (as far as we know).

When a new pathogen arrives, children often have mild disease but they
are important vectors for transmission in the community, reaching many
households. The sccond paper is the importance ofclosing schools to minimize
transmission—This was for ﬂu with a short (pm—symptomatic) incubation, but may
be even more relevant for 2019-nCoV. It rs much too early to even think of this in
the USA. but it may come to this--and sooner will be better than later, when that
time point comes.

Happy to help, any way [hall can. Thank you [or all you and NIAID are
doing!!!

Subject: coronaviruses

Hello.

Working as an occupational physician in France. I would like to draw your attention to the antiviral activity of
proton pump inhibitors, including for the Gibbon Ape Leukemia virus, a virus which does not require acidiﬁcation
of endosomes for entry into cells. as is the case with coronaviruses.

Indeed, in 2015 Long ct ol. (1) found that « .. .Thc commonly used proton pump inhibitors, Oineprazole and
Esomeprazole were also able to inhibit entry of all PVs tested but at higher drug concentrations than may be
achieved in vivo. .. ».

Using omeprazcle and esomepralole magnesium hydrate, prepared in sterile DMSO (Sigma), they concluded that it
OM and ESOM appeared to decrease ﬂuorescence, and therefore increase endosomal pI-I, only at a concentration
of ZOOuM, higher than that required to inhibit PV entry. Moreover cellular toxicity was observed at this
concentration aﬁer 24 hours... H.

In 2016, Downll et a1. (2] found : « ...Wheieas orneprnzole and esomeprazole demonstrated in vitro activity against
EBOV, the results were in line with a previous report using pseudotyped viruses where the values of drug
concentration causing 50% inhibition (ICSO) were in the region of 50 M [10]. This suggested that doses required
for potent inhibition would he ditflcult to achieve Without concomitant and signiﬁcant toxicity (the licenced dosing
for 40 mg esomepiazole, 20 mg esomeprazole and 20 mg omeprazole generates median maximum plasma
concentrations of l.59~9.6l pM, 0.514.78 iiM and 0.15735] uM, respectively.“ D.

However, oineprazole is marketed in a non-ionized form and must be ionized (in acidic enviromnent) to be

NIH Production to ICAN_000083 ””1963

transformed into an active moleculeU), It is the ionized form which establishes covalent bonds with the SI] group of
the cysteine ofthc a subunit of the proton pump

The solution used in 2015 by Jason Long et all was, a. n 2016 by Dowoll et 11]., DMSO(Dilnethyl Sulfoxide)
DMSO is a polar and aprotic organic solvent with dissociation constant pKa : 35.1 Tl '- is proonhly an explaliat'on
for the surprising ﬁndings from these studies regarding proton pump inhibitors; Inhibition of virus at 100 W (at
50 M csomeprazole for 4 of the s viruses tested) and increase in endosornnl pH only at a concentration or 200 pM

 

   

 

This is a situation which, from my point ofview, does not reﬂect the human tissue situation, because in this situation
oincprazole can be ionized in the intracellular space but also already in the extracellular space.
Besides, that’s probably its advantage: to be ionized and activated where there is an acidic environment.

Without taking into account the tissue situation and the need that omeprazole must be ionized :0 be transformed into
an actiie molecule, it would not be posssblc to explain the following publications, since it would be impossible to
obtain tissue concentrations required:

response was independent of ATP] 2A. More importantly, chronic exposure ofCF hAECs to esomeprazole
alkalinized the ASL without disrupting the epithelial barrier integrity, but this increase in ASL pH was consistent
with a decrease in mRNA expression ofATPlZA. We conclude that PPls may offer it new approach to restore ASL
pH in CF airways, which is independent ot‘t‘FTR, » (l i)

Regarding coronaviruses and Golgi complex;

a .. Coronaviruses (CoVs) acquire their envelopes from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate

synthesized in the ER and move to the ERGlC/Golgl region where they orchestrate assembly ofvirus by interacting
with the viral nucleocapsid (m‘l. Once virions have budded into the lumen ofthe ERGlC, the ~l 20 rim particles
must move through the host secretory pathway to be released from infected cells. Coronnvinlscs are believed to
follow the constitutive retory pathwuy for cxocytos , although only a few studies have uddre led the release of
virionsr During infection, a progressive disruption or Golgi structure is observed, with swollen unstacked cistemae

compartment is not known. Large vacuoles containing budded virions are observed in infected cells. presumably en

n ...It might be worth investigating whether ionechannel inhibitors. such as amantadine, or proton pump
inhibitors speciﬁcally are able to inhihit this increase in Golgi pH. Fornow. though, it still remains to bc seen
whether Cov release is mediated by viroporin ion channel activity or through Fish with host proteins ofthe

antiviral errert ofnnnnnin ronid he relieved hy the addition of different sro ki o initihitors, indicating that Sm
signaling mediated via ATPIAI plays a erueial role in the inhibition of CoV and vsv infections...» (25)

 

In conclusion, in order to verify the possible efﬁcacy of omeprazole and csOincprazole in the control of infection by
coronaviruscs :

The equivalent of the maximum serum concentration that can be obtained in the human body should be used
and tested in active (ionized‘t fomi in vitro.
Lnlike an in vitro test. the human body is an open system, a dissipative system. However, local concentrations of the
ionized form should not exceed semm concentrations of the inactive non-ionized form in the absence of active
transport.
But the transformation front the non-ionized form to the ionized form could continue until the saturation ofthe
reactions at the cellular level or urltil the depletion ofthe transformation capacity from the inactive form to an active
form, linked to 2i change in acidity or the depletion ofthe inactive form.

As omepiazcle can modify or even inhibit the action ofthe MZ piotein of the inﬂuenza vtlus at the cellulai
level (26), based on a computer simulation test. it would be desirabe to check the interaction capabilities of
omcprnzolc with protein E of the coronavirus. Protein E is likely to resemble the protein M2 in its mode of action.

In the absence ofa treatment recognized as effective in the context ofa coronavirus infection and in the
ahsenee of data clearly demonstrating the ineffectiveness of omeprazoie, personally, I would he tempted to take
omepruole after being in Contact [at a distznce ofless than 2 to 3 meters) w'th people at risk ofcoritamination or ifl
had the ﬁrst symptotnti, hoping for the inhihitnry activity ofomeprayoln on Pvtype ATPnses (77, as) in the t~nniext
of coronavirus cxocytosis. in analogy to the action "offtarget on the endosoinal vATPase" during cndocytosis
processes.

This step, if effective. will not prevent infection, but could lesseni importancc. slow the process down and give the
immune system a complementary option to defend itself...

Personal experience‘ using omeprazole in the context of seasonal respiratory viral infections since 2007.
reminds me of the indication to divide the daily dose into two daily doses (omeprazole 10mg moming and evening is
usually already effective for seasonal respiratory viral infections). According to the evolution and the importance of
inﬂammatory state i associate an antihis'amine. eg cetirizine.
in the context of the coronavirus, 1 would be tempted

share the maximum permissible daily dose of omeprazole in 3 divided doses after being in contact with
people at risk ofcontamination at a d.stance of less than 2 to 3 meters

divide the daily dose of olnepi’azole into two daily doses in ease of minor symptoms

take the duily dose ofomeprazoie in u single dose ifthe symptoms worsen with repercussions on the general
condition

to resume the daily dose of omeprazoie in two daily doses when the symptoms ofseverity diminish.

The etibctiveness of esontcprazole may be greater than omcprazole.

NIH Production to ICAN_000086

Taking into account the aforementioned publications, it should not be forgotten that omeprozole will reduce
secretions at the respiratory level. A positive effect on respiratory retions during acute viral respiratory diseases
which can become negative (by modifying the pH, the ciliary inohi y and the volume of secretions) dLring
prolonged use. thus promoting the risk of haeterial pneumonia (29).

The advantages anti disadvantages may vary depending on the user phenotype of oniepramle with regard to
cytochrome P 450 (30‘).

Robert Gebelhoff

Assistant editor and Opinions contributor

Feb. 10, 2020 at 2:22 pm. EST

The latest strain of coronavirus continues to rage across China. Its death to” has surpassed 900, ecligsing
the body count from China’s EARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003.

To get a better sense of the disease and the US. government’s response to it, we spoke to Anthony S.
Fauci, immunologist and director of the National Institute of Allergy and infectious Diseases at the
National Institutes of Health. Below is a transcript of an interview with Fauci, edited for clarity and
brevity

Robert Gebelhoff: Right off the bat, what makes this virus different?

Anthony Fauci Well, we have to be concerned whenever there’s a virus that has — and l'm going to use
a big word here — pathogenic potential. [The coronavirus] is brand»new, and there's no real
underlying experience with it, so the general population is naive with regard to protection. And it has
serious potential, because it’s already spreading rapidly. it’s the unknown aspect of something that
already tells you it’s a serious problem. We don’t know where it’s going.

Gebelhoff: Are we past the point of containment for this coronavirus?

Fauci: No, we're not. The short answer is we’re not past the point of containment. But it really does
have the potential to turn into a global pandemic, What we have now is a very serious epidemic in
China. [But outside of China.] there is very little -— but some - transmission from person to person,
Once you get multiple countries that have sustained transmission from person to person, then it's
beyond the situation where you can contain it, You can only mitigate it.

In the United States, we are clearly in the containment phase. And what we’ve done is we’ve
identified. We've isolated, And we’ve done contact-tracing [identifying who might have come in contact
with an infected person]. That seems to be successful. But once it it starts spreading all over the world
then it's almost inevitable that it’s going to start spreading here.

Gebelhoff: The Post reported last week that China withheld information from the public, including
silencing medical professionals. and that this made the spread of the virus worse. How does the United
States work with a government that we can’t even trust to tell the truth to its people?

NIH Production to ICAN_000096 ””0019“

Fauci: That is an issue. And it’s the reason why I have been saying that we need some of our people —~
CDC, NIH people — there on the ground, both helping and seeing with their own eves exactly the extent
of this. We want to be part ofa [World Health Organilation] convening group that goes there. But thus
far, we’ve not been able to make that a reality.

Gebelhoff. And why's that?

Fauci: I don’t know, We have asked. We have colleagues _ scientific colleagues — ll'l China that we’ve
dealt with for years ifnot decades. Many of them have trained in the United States. And we know them
as friends and as colleagues. They are the ones that are not holding back. But they're not the ones
that make the official proclamations of what comes out. The solution to the problem in the question
you’re posing is that we really do want people there, so that we can not only help them but also provide
some expertise that might supplement or complement their own expertise.

Gebelhoff: What does the United States do if [the coronavirus] does become a pandemic in the
developing world?

Fauci: Well obviously we will try to help them to contain as best as possible. Right now, by definition,
it Is not truly a global pandemic. it lS a very serious outbreak and epidemic In China, but the amount of
sustained transmission outside of China is still minimal. But there are some countries where it is going
to be very difficult to stop the evolution into sustained transmission. Obviously the [World Health
Organization] and the global security network that we put up over the years will try to help those
countries, but there’s no guarantee that we‘ll be successful.

Gebelhoff: On that paint, the head of the WHO has criticized travel bans and restrictions around the
world as not helpful to stopping the outbreak. He said it was potentially "increasing fear and stigma.”
What

Faucl: Everyone agrees that travel bans and restrictions are almost never successful in completely
stopping something is that invariably going to turn into a pa ndemic. What we are trying to do is to
pause temporarily and give China enough time to putthe lid on [this virus] to prevent it from becoming
global and to give us a little more tlme to prepare. There’s no indication or imagination that if this
becomes a global pandemic that travel restrictions are going to mean anything. But they can mean
something, as a tem porizing activity.

Gebelhoff: What should the average person be doing right now about coronavirus?

Fauci: It’s a good question. 1) They should realize at this point, it is a low risk. And 2) that risk can
change, so pay attention to what'sgoing on [and] to the announcements coming from the CDC. The
things that you do for influenza — get vaccinated, wash your hands, avoid crowded places — are exactly
the same things that you would do if we did get coronavirus here. So the question is, should we do
anything different from what we‘re already doing? No. Should we all be wearing a mask? Absolutely
not

Subject: Potential Trearnent Strategy to Reduce Motality Caused by Coronavirus infection

 

Dear Dr. Fauci:

One effective way to get things done is through the individuals like you at the frontline with authorities.
I know that you are very busy, and i am sorry to bother you. You probably already knew what I'm going
to say and appear to be so relaxed.

with the significant concern for the quick spread of coronavirus infection, I would like to propose a ce||~
based immunomodulation strategy to reduce the "cytoklne storm", the main pathoohysiologcal cause
for the mortality. The scientific rationale regarding this strategy has been partially discussed in an article
entitled “ Extending the Horizon of Cell Based Immunotherapy by Understanding the Mechanisms of
Action of Photopheresis" and other related articles on this topic.

Several potential treatment modality could be derived from this concept if more laboratory and clinical
data supportthis motion, which include: (1) ozone therapy ( withdraw about 50 ml — 100 ml blood
from patient in transfusion bag, mixing with small amount of ozone ex vivoand reainfuse back to patient
in 30 minutes); (2) Cupping therapy (medically induced subcutaneous hemorrhage by heat and vacuums
effects) to expose self antigens to the abundant dendritic cells in the subcutaneous tissue in order to
reinforce the self antigen tolerance. The best timing for these inten/entions in theory would be at the

period of fever, virernia stages These simple approaches can be incorporated with the other medical
treatments and supportive care.

I cannot be certain, but want to help as a holistic physicians Thank you very much for reading this email
and providing vour insight as well as help.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Fauci,

The Trilateral Commission will hold its invitation-only annual plenary meeting in Washington, DC, on
March 13—15, 2020. I would like to invite you to participate in a conversation at the meeting on
responding to the coronavirus and global pandemics.

As you may know, the Trilateral Commission was launched by David Rockefeller in 1973 to think through
the shared challenges and leadership responsibilities of the three principal industrialized democratic
areas ofthe world: Europe, North American, and Japan [now Asia). Today, the Commission believes its
original mission of bringing democratic countries together to tackle international challenges should once
again be a major priority for ourcountryand our partners. This year's plenary meeting is a major, three
day gathering of our global membership during which we will explore the theme "Democracy and
Capitalism at a Crossroads."

Subject: RE. Heat kills novel Coronavirus
Eric:

The following is all on background. Coronaviruses in general tend to circulate
and infect predominantly in the winter season (Northern and Southern
hemispheres have opposite seasons). We do not know for sure why this is the
case; however, many believe that the enclosed spaces in winter (mostly indoor
because it is cold) allows better spread of a respiratory borne virus. Also, some
viruses tend to thrive in cold, dry weather as opposed to warm, m0Ist weather.
Remember, however, that when it is summer here, it is winter in Australia and
Argentina. This may be the genesis of the information given to President Xi and
President Trump that the virus may ”go away” in the warm weather. However,
this is a brand new virus with which we have no prior experience and it is entirely
conceivable that seasonal changes will not have any impact on the spread.

Hope that this is helpful.
Best,
Tony

We’ve been seeing a lot about people saying the heat will kill the novel coronavirus? Is this medically
sound?

Trump discussed Coronavirus briefly: He said he had a long talk with President Xi two nights ago, and the
Chinese president told him “the heat generally kills this kind of virus!’

The president claimed the virus will go away in April asthe seasons change. “The virus that we're talking

Hi Tony,

I need a Fauci brain dump,

You may have seen this:

httns: /www.nzherald.tonz/worltynews/artieleennlc id:Z&nbiectidTI2307276

is this news? Dun‘t we already know that the virus spread via droplet transmission? This rti
transmi ion means “it ran lloat it long distance to the air and cause infection later when it breathed in." "final
makes it sound like the kind or spread that happens Willi measles. when: the Virus can linger in a morn and inlet-t
somebody 2 hours at‘tersornehody with measles leaves the room.

 

Tomorrow, I will be giving an hour and a half ofafﬁliatc debrieﬁngs on this Virus. So we will be reaching millions
ofpeople. I‘d love to get the latest and greatest public health message. Incidentally, Howard chlter and the
infectious disease folks at NYU Langone are very concerned about overloading our emergency rooms with patients
who have upper resptratory infection symptoms What is the right message? If somebody calls thinking they have
coronavirus, do you tell them to come ln 7 risking infection ofolhers" Do they stay home and wait for symptoms [0
get worse‘,7 Of course. it would be great ifynu cnulrl send them a kit and happen to home testing. But that's nowhere
in the near future. right?

It's regarding the update in the story of Coronavirus - The World Health

and centered at the Universiy of Alabama at Birmingham,
is being used to treat select infected patients in the United States and in China who have been affected
by the outbreak of novel coronavirus (20157nCoV).

UAB was awarded a $37 5 million,ﬁve-year U19 grant from the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases Centers of Excellence for Translational Research to study and develop treatment for
high»priority emerging infections. Work has been taking place in earnest to develop drugs for emerging
influenza, flaviviruses (dengue, West Nile virus and Zika), coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, and
alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and chikungunya. The grant is a multi—

 

NIH Production to ICAN_000123 ”“0020“

institutional collaboration to accelerate drug discovery for these emerging infectionsand is a public-
private partnership between academic institutions and Gilead Sciences,

Remdesivir, developed to treat the coronavirus causing MERS, was found to have significant activity
against the 2019-nCoV strain when the outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Importantly,
remdesivir had demonstrated efficacy in treating other medically important coronaviruses MERS and
SARS in cell culture and animal models. Based on the compassionate plea requests of treating physicians
in the United States, Gilead Sciences released remdesivir for use in a few patients, although the drug has
not yet been tested for safety or efficacy in these diseases. ”The release of remdesivir for safety and
efficacy studies is a major accomplish merit for the ADSC - namely the U19 grant - as it shows significant
and swift advance of antiviral drugs to help treat and respond to emerging infectious disease outbreaks
on an international scale and, importantly, to anticipate the introduction of these infections in the
United States,” said Richard Whitley, M.D,, Distinguished Professor at UAB and principal investigatorof
the U19 grant.

WATCH: UAB infectious disease experts provide information on the 2019 novel coronavirus.

Gilead Sciences and supporting researchers and clinicians are working with health authorities from the
World Health Organization and in China to establish a placebo-controlled study to determine whether
remdesivir is safe and effective in treating 2019-nCoV.

“This is a prime example of how the research we
are conducting at UAB plays a critical role in
treating patients on a global scale and our
contribution of substantial scientific advances.”

— Richard Whitley, M,D,, UAB Distinguished
Professor

“The collaboration between UAB, our colleagues at Southern Research, Vanderbilt University and the
University of North Carolina, along with our pharmaceutical partner Gilead Sciences, is indicative of our
collaborative approach to respond to outbreaks in real time, and in helping communities worldwide
fight 20197nCoV. This is a prime example of how the research we are conducting at UAB plays a critical
role in treating patients on a global scale and our contribution of substantial scientific advances,"
Whitley continued.

Whitley expressed that the potential for mutation of 2019-nCoV means that UAB’s AD3C and partners
will need to build backup molecules for potential testing and treatment in the near future.

The World Health Organization has declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a “public health emergency of
international concern."

UAB isthe lead institution for AD3C and research conducted: but the team unifies scientists experienced
in virology, viral immunology, pathogenesis, medicinal chemistry and translation to human disease from
UAB, University of North Carolina, Vanderbilt University, Emory University, Washington University, The

University of Colorado, Denver, and Oregon Health & Science University.

HI Dr Fauci,

I hope you’re doing well. I know you must be very busy.

Our editor, D12 Elizabeth Rosenthal, is wondering whether the new coronavirus might be
spreading through plumbing on the cruise ship? She sent me these links. below, about how
plumbing played a role in spreading SARS in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong
Kong. Libby lived in China during the SARS outbreaks and remembers that the sinks there don’t
have the typical U-bend trap that sinks have here. which allows sewer gases and unpleasant

odors to come through

lfplumbing is a risk for spreading coronavimses, what could be done to protect passengers on
cruise ships?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this even ifjust by email

Please let me know if you have any suggested edits, and I’ll move it along.

Thanks
Kathy

Enrica Battifoglia
Science and Technology Head Editor
ANSA news agency (Italian news)

EnricarBattifogliaQansa.it
Expected place of publication: ANSA Science web page (www.ansa.lt(sclenza)

Dear Professor Fauci,

I am Enrica Battifoglia of the Italian news agency ANSA, I already have had the pleasure to
interview you several times at the AIDS world conferences.

I would like to ask you some questions about Coronavirus 2019-nCoV, to be published on the
ANSA Science web page (www,ansaJt/sctcnza), the main online science news resource in Italy
with over 1.5M contacts each month. I am sure that your clarity and competence will be highly
valuable to put some much-needed order among so many contrasting news and data, and would
be much appreciated by our readers.

NIH Production to ICAN_000141 ””0020”

1. Do the current available data allow to understand the threat level of coronavirus 2019-
nCoV in terms of both lethality and diffusion speed, and about the possible evolution
scenarios of the disease?

There is much that we do not know about the novel coronavirus. Currently, there have been more
than 37,000 conﬁrmed cases in China, and China has reported more than 800 deaths. As you
know, there have been three conﬁrmed cases in Italy to date. The reported case fatality rate
(lethality) among the 37,000 cases that have come to the attention of the health care system
is 2%. However, given that there are likely many more cases that are without symptoms
or with minimal symptoms , the actual death rate is probably lower than 2%.

It is impossible to predict how the virus wilI evolve. It is our hope that the extraordinary
containment measures that China has implemented will help prevent the outbreak from
becoming a global pandemic. But given mat the virus is present in 27 countries to date and can
be lrausrnilled from person-lo-person, it may lake a foothold and evolve into a global pandemic.

2) What exactly do we know about its modes of transmission. especially from people who
do not yet have the symptoms?

Again, there is much that we do not know about the novel coronavirus, including its specific
transmission abilities. Based on initial ﬁndings that have been reported, we suspect its
transmission is similar to inﬂuenza and other respiratory viruses, namely that is transmitted
through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and by touching
surfaces, such as door handles, that recently have virus on them and then touching your face.
There have also been reports that the virus is present in feces and vomit. However, it is still
uncertain that the virus can be transmitted through this route

Traditionally, most viruses are transmitted when someone has symptoms. With the novel
coronavirus; however, there appears to be asymptomatic transmission occurring. We do not
know how many cases are being driven by asymptomatic transmission or by those with
symptoms. Typically, viruses are largely transmitted by infected people experiencing symptoms.

3) Are the genetic sequences provided by China enough to start working on a vaccine?

The genetic sequences provided by China enabled researchers to quickly develop a diagnostic
lhal is being used to delennine whelher someone is infected with the novel coronavirus. The
genetic information has also been useful in work to develop a preventive vaccine. The National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, is
building on its experience With the SARS and MERS eoronaviruses to better understand the virus
as well as develop and test rapid point-of—care diagnostics, Vaccines and treatments, including
broadespectrum antivirals and antibody therapies, In terms of vaccines speciﬁcally, we are

NIH Production to ICAN_000142

working with the biotechnology company Modema and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovation (CEPI) to develop a “messenger RNA” vaccine for the novel coronavirus. Other
countries and companies are working to develop a vaccine as well.

4) What are the technical times to develop a working vaccine in terms of scientiﬁc research,
and what are the approx times for the necessary legal certiﬁcations, and for industrial
production and distribution?

In terms of our work with Modema and CEPI to develop a vaccine, we anticipate having an
experimental vaccine ready for Phase 1 clinical trials within 2 to 3 months. 'l'his Phase 1 clinical
trial will involve administering the vaccine to a small number of healthy adults in the United
States to see if it is safe and has some ability to induce an immune response. lfthat is successful
and the outbreak has not ended, we will move to a larger Phase 2 clinical trial with the
expectation ofproving the efﬁcacy (or not) of the vaccine within 1 to 1.5 years. If
efﬁcacious, it will still take additional months to produce enough vaccine to distribute
widelv..

In addition to this vaccine, NIAID is also supporting scientists and companies to develop other
vaccine candidates,

5) 2019-nCov is the third Coronavirus aggressive for humans that has appeared in the East
in the last 20 years and in 2009 the virus responsible for the flu pandemic too did come
from China: what sort of preventive measures could be practicable to reduce the risk of
repetition of these events?

To clarify, the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus was first reported in Mexico, not China.

Viruses affecting humans have occurred throughout history, from the Bubonic Plague to the
1918 flu. We cannot predict what emerging infectious diseases will occur nor prevent the
unknown from occurring in the first place. What we can do is learn as much as we can about
emerging Viruses, so that we can rapidly develop safe and effective point—of—care diagnostics,
treatments and vaccines to protect against infection.

Boston

Hi Dr. Fauci

I am a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Cowen and Company, a New Vork City based
investment company that specializes in health care. Each year we host a Health Care
Conference in Boston In March that attracts 200+ companies and 1000+ investors. During this
year's conference, we had planned to host a one—hour panel discussion on the evolution ofand
reforms within the China Health Care System and China Pharmaceutical market. However,
given global concerns around Coronavirus, we have decided to focus the panel instead on the
virus and the outlook for emerging treatments. This perspective is critical to health care
companies and therefore the institutions that invest in them.

Our panel will take place during Cowen's 40th Annual Health Care Conference, which will be
held at the Marriott Copley Place in Boston on March 2—4, 2020. We plan to host this panel on

Monday morning, March 2"“, between 9:05-10:05AM. Attendees at our conference include
institutional investors from insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, banks, and
other types of funds, mainly in the U5. and EU.

Cowen would provide you an honorarium for your time during the one-hour panel. We propose
an honorarium of $1,500, and we reimburse conference-related travel expenses.

The discussion will be Q&A only and no presentation on your part is requested.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,

Steve Scala

Good morning.
I’d like to follow up on yesterday's inquiry from our reporter Neal.

If Dr. Fauci is available to address the concerns of this cruise ship inJapan
with Corona virus (re air circulation system) today, we'd love him to have
him on.

Unfortunately, the first available interview time is after 11 a.m.

If it works, please let me know. This time, we’d like to record an interview to
be used for air so we have some flexibility.

Hi, Dr. Fauci. Hope you're Well

Spoke With some passengers aboard the Diamond
Princess cruise ship in Japan, where the number of
coronavlrus cases onboard are jumping. Can we do
a brief interview re: thoughts on quarantining on
board ship (with, Iwould assume a closed
circulating air system) versus evacuating them?

I'm available at your earliest convenience. Or, if
you'd like to just emall some thoughts, that'd be
great. Thanks and best.

Hello Dr Fauci.
By way of introduction, I was Jim MacLowry’s last fellow at the NIH and have been working in the UK since then
as a medical microbiologist and hospital epidemiologisl.
I am the lead medical microbiologist at the Royal Society of Medicine in the UK and was wondering about your
availability please to speak at a conference on emergenl Coronavirus threats to be held at the RSM on November
24th coming?
The RSM is a unique educational charity here and we have councils covering all aspects of healthcare. The program
is still developing lyutl wanted to check on your availability quickly- we have an academic fund to which I can
apply to cover your trip but will need to do so soon.
It was both exciting and inspirational being a senior staff fellow at the NIH - my background is international;

and the international perspectives
at the NIH were so encouraging. All non- American fellows recognised the national strategic remit ofthe NIH for
the US , but I have oﬁen wondered if an assessment has ever been made of how fellows like myself have brought the
spirit ofthat institution to other nations
With kind regards
lan

Today, butl wanted to see if you could were available to offer your quick reaction to the Supplementary
Index published today (attached) in the New England Journal of Medicine regarding the widely reported

Looking at the patient's daily take on how she felt it's unclear to me whether this qualifies as

Subject: BuzzFeed News: 2019-nCOV vaccine development questions

Dr Fauci,

As you may recall, l'm a science reporter at BuzzFeed News We wonderif you might have any
perspective (or might recommend someone to comment) for a novel coronavirus story we are writing
for this weekend, regarding vaccine efforts.

In short, we wonder how you see an eventual vaccine playing a role in the future ofthe outbreak? CDC
has described the virus as not mutating as much as influenza -- does that suggest a vaccine would
provide more than seasonal protection?

In the long term, we had a few other questions. Is this something you could see added to the MMR
protocol for the general public, or only in regions where there are local outbreaks (is there an analogy to
SAKS or MERS vaccines in this contemplated use)? is there any aspect ofa race against time in vaccine
development if this coronavirus is seasonal like influenza?

We are basically trying to understand where a vaccine fits into the future response to this new virus. we
asked you these sort of questions about the Zika vaccine efforts and your perspective really helped a lot.
Apologies for all the questions, if you had any perspective, we'd be grateful

Hi Anthony,

I hope this email finds you well! My name is Amanda Morris and I’m a bioscience reporter at the Arizona
Republic, part of the USA Today network. I’m reaching out because I’m currently working on a story
about how some ASU researchers [Brenda Hogue, BertJacobs and Shawn Chen) are trying to develop
strategies to make a vaccine against the new coronavirus as well as a general platform they can use in
the case of future new coronavirus strain outbreaks in humans.

I know globally there are many researchers trying to develop a vaccine for this new coronavirus, and
that the NIH is working with Moderna to do so - and hopes to start testing with in a few months, I’m
wondering if I can talk to you over the phone and ask a few questions about the work that NIH is doing,
and what the broader challenges are for developing a vaccine? I’d like to have broader context about
vaccines for our readers,

Please let me know as soon as possible. You can call or text me at ﬂaw} Thank you!

Couple big thank yous from prominent science writers — NVT/WSJ — said learned more listening to you
for 30 minutes then everything they read in the last few weeks.

My response when you have a very wise scientist, who hears the question and answers the question,
and has 40+ years of experience we should listen and learn.

French drugmaker Sanofi working on coronavirus initiative

CHINA-HEALTH/SANOFI (PIX):French drugmaker Sanoﬁ working on coronavirus
initiative

PARIS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanoﬁ will announce a new coronavirus initiative
within the next two weeks, its chief executive said on Thursday, adding that it wants to present
something concrete and not add to "fantasies".

At least a dozen dmgmakers are working on vaccines or antivirals to help those infected with the
fast-spreading Virus that has killed more than 500 people in China. but several have warned that
development of treatments will take time,

NIH Production to ICAN_000199 ””2195

"We have seen a ﬂurry of activities from other companies,” CEO Paul Hudson told a news
conference after Sanoﬁ published 2019 results on Thursday.

"We are one of the few companies that has the expertise to know when it is just a fantasy, or
when it could be real, In the next week or two, you will see something more conﬁnnatory about
the approach we will lake."

Hudson declined to give further details.

Sanoﬁ had already said it was sharing its expertise and data acquired from other outbreaks with
the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). which is working with biotech
businesses to try to develop a vaccine candidate for the coronavirus.

Britain's GlaxoSmithKline is also collaborating with CEPI.

"The objective here is not a newspaper headline, it is real work that will make a difference,"
Hudson said.

Good morning Tony.

Given your most recent appointment, I wanted to show
you the courtesy of letting you know what I have already
provided to senior leaders at the White House regarding a
possible mitigating strategy until the deﬁnitive solution to
the CoV is available and implemented. The string below
includes additional information as to how titanium dioxide
can fit into both the White House and the
National/International solutions, and the open—source
website for the company. Please keep in mind that
because this product is already approved and in use in the
EU for a variety of commercial uses, the data provided
does not speciﬁcally address the applications I, and you,
are interested in. However, with a deep understanding of
the White House mission, I can say that there is not a big
leap in that thought migration.

Dr. Jackson has already provided the same material to
some of your White House Commission colleagues. I will
also be reaching out to another friend of mine from the
Bush—now-Trump Administration, Steve Biegun.

Good morning Gentlemen,
Ijustspuke with Ronny and believe I need to offer A relevant update and one point of explanation.

First, the company's joint venture partner in india is meeting with the Indian government as we speak.
It appears likelythat in light of the news oflndia's introduction to the corona virus the government will
utilize their ”National Catastrophe Budget” to expedite the funding necessary to secure and execute a

contract with this company,

Secondly, | WI” attach the open source web site iorthe company to provide you background information
that, out of respect for your time and forthe sake of brevity, I left out of yesterday's note. It’s
important to note a couple of things

This product is already proved and is in use in the EU with all the approvals appropriate for the same.

Secondly, in our language, this is a “standoff productr"—l.e. you apply it once and it continues to
decontaminate and disinfect in the background for up to 175 years before retreating. (Depending on the
type of use, normal daily cleaning using their cleaning solution—that is cheaper and more effective than
what the application normally would use, e.g. in a hotel—continues). The chemical treats anything
organic, Le. bacteria, viruses, VOC, bio threats, etc, because it is a catalyst, it is neither used up, nor

NIH Production to ICAN_000208 N‘HOUZ‘ZZ

does it produce microbial resistance or superbugs. |t decontaminates and disinfects surfaces (e,g,
airplanes and government critical infrastructures) and the air around the surface (and HVAC filters and
air handlers).

The leadership will be in DC next week. I highly encourage any and all potential stakeholders make time
to meet with them while they are here, To that end, I had already emailed Dr. Fauci (with whom i
worked a great deal on similar chalenges during the Bush Administration) before the announcement of
his participation on the new coronavirus commission, I will also reach out to an old friend and colleague
Steve BIEGUN now that he is in the commission. Please feel free to forward the information to others as
you deem appropriate.

Thanks,

Dick Tubb

Gentlemen, Brothers, and Others...

This is Dick Tubb, writing on behalf of
Admiral Jackson and Dr. Hofmann (both
copied herein). It feels like "old times"-—l'm
undecided as to whether they are good old
times, or otherwise. Regardless, it does feel
like we've been down a very similar road
before. Perhaps we can apply some of the

lessons—learned to the inevitable problems
ahead.

NIH Production to ICAN_000209 N‘Hmzm

In light of the current and evolving threat
presented by the corona virus, I am writing
to you as a courtesy to inform you of a
project that Admiral Jackson, Dr.
Hofmann, and I have been consulting on.
We believe so strongly in the technology,
people, and potential that we have been
consulting pro bone and currently have no
ﬁnancial stake in the project. While not
developed speciﬁcally designed for such
purposes, I increasingly believe that until a
vaccination and treatment for the corona
virus is available, this technology may be
the last best chance in containing, and
eradicating the virus, thereby protecting
the homeland, our economy, the Continuity
of the Presidency, an Enduring
Constitutional Government, our people and
our Country. Moreover, reverting to my
"lessons-learned, problems-ahead"
statement, even after this crisis is over, and
a vaccine and treatment procured, it will
only be a matter of time until "next time."
This letter is proof—positive of that reality.
My experiences, especially in the early
2000's (e.g. anthrax and other biothreats,
SARS, etc.) underpin my beliefs.

The technology that provides the solution,

both now and in the future, involves a
unique formulation of a photo catalytic

NIH Production to ICAN_000210

nano titanium dioxide solution (the Air
Force guys will, of course, understand what
that means, so you non-Air Force folks, just
buy them a beer and they'll explain it to
you) that is safer, more effective, and more
cost effective than any other solution. It
was developed and approved in the EU, and
I have asked the senior leadership of the
company to come to Washington DC next
week. Dr. Hofmann and I spent the day
yesterday with a Chinese “titan" respected
by and with access to the most senior
government officials, academic and medical
giants, and investment and industry
captains. I have encouraged, and he has
agreed in principal, to follow our
recommendations as they relate to their
largest airline, and their key facilities.

In short, our strategic priority is to first
fortify the weak link in the pandemic chain:
the airlines. Doing so will provide the time
necessary to isolate, contain, and ultimately
destroy the threat at its source
(Wuhan),and in its home (China). As
President Bush so commonly stated about a
very different threat, we need to fight the
battle over there, so that we don't have to
ﬁght the battle here. Although President
Bush was a true believer in the threat of a
pandemic, I believe this threat, and the

NIH Production to ICAN_000211

threats that are surely to follow are, in
reality, many, many times greater than the
threat he envisioned when making that
statement. By fighting a possible
impending pandemic at its source we will
preserve and protect the safety and
conﬁdence of our people, and the strength
of our economy.

Once we have interrupted the threat supply
chain, we can then shore up our critical
infrastructure using the same technology
and process, then assist the Chinese in
addressing their challenges, and protect
our international allies elsewhere. In that
vein, in addition to the Chinese, I have also
discussed this technology and strategy with
senior proxies for another of my former
patients, His Royal Highness, the Crown
Prince of Saudi Arabia, and his father, the
King.

As I noted above, I have asked the
leadership of the company to come to
Washington (from Germany and Denmark)
next week for a variety of meetings. While
Admiral Jackson will be "tied up in Texas"
for the foreseeable future, please let me
know if you would like to meet with myself
or Dr. Hofmann, or the company

NIH Production to ICAN_000212

leadership while they are here, to learn
more.

Thank you and my best to you all as you
plan for and continue to protect our
Country,

Very Respectfully,
Dick Tubb

Shoreland's Travax News Alert Service—
Abbreviated

China: More than 2,800 Cases of 2019-nCoV in 30
Provinces/Municipalities, Mainly in Wuhan; Cases
Exported to 16 Countries

WHAT'S NEW

According to regional health authorities, more than 1.800 additional.
confirmed cases (including 25 deaths) of pneumonia caused by 2019
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been reported slnce January 27,
2020, throughout the country, mainly in the provinces of Hubel (1,291),
Guangdong (207), Zhejiang (173), Henan (168), and Hunan (143)and in
the cities of Chongqing (132), Beijing (19), and Shanghai (13). Most new
cases had a travel history to Wuhan. Almost all the recent deaths occurred
in Hubei Provincei Twenty more patients have recovered and been

NIH Production to ICAN_000213

discharged. More than 4.600 conﬁrmed cases (including > 100 deaths)
have occurred since December 6, 2019.

A total of 13 additional. exported, confirmed cases have been reported
(through January 28, 2:00 pm. EST) since Monday, January 27. More
than 25 cases have been exported in the past 7 days. Cases reported
since Monday arrived in the following countries on the dates shown:
Singapore (January 19 and 23), Taiwan (January 22), Japan (January 20
and 21), France (arrival date unknown). and Thailand (arrival dates
unknown). All of these cases had travel history to Wuhan or contact with
an ill person from Wuhan while in China.

In addition to these exported cases, 7 locally acquired cases have been
reported since Monday in Germany (4), Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam. The
cases in Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam reported contact with an obviously in
person from China. In Germany all 4 cases had close contact in a
buSiness seminar with an apparently asymptomatic Chinese woman on
January 21 (who preViously had contact with relatives from Wuhan), the
women states symptom onsel was on a flight to Shanghai on January 23,
and she w ater continued to have 2019-nCoV. Incubation periods in
these cases have been as short as 3 days. In light of the secondary cases
in Germany in a business setting, the most cautious approach of having
arrivals stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days after their last possible
exposure in China is increasingly justiﬁed.

 

Updated travel advisories include: 1) Australia: reconsider travel to China;
2) Canada: avoid all travel to Hubei Province; 3) Finland: avoid
nonessential travel to Hubei Province; 4) France: avoid all travel to Hubei
Province, 5) Germany: avoid nonessential travel to China and avoid all
travel to Hubei Province; 6) India: avoid all nonessential travel to China: 7)

OVERALL RISK ASSESSMENT

The epidemic in China is months from peaking. A report indicates that just
prior to the cordoning off of Wuhan, over 5 million residents (many
potentially infectious) left for other parts of China, and many thousands left
for Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan. Exported cases have so
far been to countries likely to be capable of controlling (but not preventing)
ongoing transmission. which will inevitably occur. in light ofthe secondary
cases in Germany in a business setting, the most cautious approach of
haVing arrivals stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days after their last
possible exposure in China is increasingly justified.

Based on increasing data on virology clinical presentation, and
transmission, this coronavirus closely resembles SARS‘CoV in many
behaviors. Fortunately, sequential sequencing of viral isolates over time
indicate no signiﬁcant new viral mutations; mutations often increase
transmission or virulence. WHO assesses the risk of this event to be very
high in ChinaI high at the regional level, and high at the global level. The
closing of Wuhan airport and the major cities of Hubei province have yet to
stem the ﬂow of exported cases. The orig ally implicated animal market,
now closed indeﬁnitely, bears little relevance to the ongoing situation.
Whether the market was the focus ofa species Jump from animals to
humans or merely one of multiple ampliﬁcation settings for initial uses is
increasingly unclear. The degree of human-to-human spread outside of
Hubei province remains unclear. A reproductive number, R0, is estimated

at 1.4—2.5 by Chinese authorities and up to 5.5 by other scientists An RD
greater than 1 indicates that each case leads to more than 1 subsequent
case. making control much more difﬁcult. The spectrum ofdisease
manifestations in a large cohort study has yet to be disclosed: a severe
case rate of 20% has been consistent. The existence of mildly
symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious cases could increase the risk of
global spread. Case fatality is impossible to ascertain at present, and
lesser or greater clinical virulence compared to MERS-Cov or SARS—CoV
remains speculative.

2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak Report—
comprehensive

Last updated January 28, 2020,

What‘s New

According to regional health authorities, more than 1,800 additional, confirmed cases
(including 25 deaths) of pneumonia caused by 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
have been reported since January 27. 2020, throughout the country, mainly in the
provinces of Hubei (1,291), Guangdong (207), Zhejiang (173), Henan (168), and Hunan
(143) and in the cities of Chongqing (132), Beijing (19), and Shanghai (13). Most new
cases had a travel history to Wuhan Almost all the recent deaths occurred in Hubei
Province, Twenty more patients have recovered and been discharged, More than 4,600
conﬁrmed cases (including > 100 deaths) have occurred since December 8, 2019

A total of 13 additional, exported, confirmed cases have been reported (through
January 28, 2:00 pm. EST) since Monday, Januaw 27, More than 25 cases have been
exported in the past 7 days. Cases reported since Monday arrived in the following
countries on the dates shown: Singapore (January 19 and 23), Taiwan (January 22),
Japan (January 20 and 21), France (arrival date unknown), and Thailand (arrival dates
unknown). All of these cases had travel history to Wuhan or contact with an ill person
from Wuhan while in China.

In addition to these exported cases, 7 locally acquired cases have been reported since
Monday in Germany (4), Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The cases in Japan, Taiwan,
and Vietnam reported contact with an obviously ill person from China. In Germany, all 4
cases had close contact in a business seminar with an apparently asymptomatic
Chinese woman on January 21 (who previously had contact with relatives from Wuhan);
the woman states symptom onset was on a ﬂight to Shanghai on January 23, and she
was later confirmed to have 2019-nCoV. lncubation periods in these cases have been
as short as 3 days, In light of the secondary cases in Germany in a business setting,
the most cautious approach of having arrivals stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days
after their last possible exposure in China is increasinglyjustiﬁedt

Updated travel advisories include 1)Australia: reconSider travel to China; 2) Canada:
avoid all travel to Hubei Province; 3) Finland: avoid nonessential travel to Hubei
Province; 4) France: avoid all travel to Hubei Province 5) Germany: avoid nonessential
travel to China and avoid all travel to Hubei Province; 6) India: avoid all nonessential
travel to China; 7) New Zealand: avoid all travel to Hubei Provmce; 8) Taiwan: avoid all
nonessential travel to China

Singapore now denies entry to residents of Hubei Province and those who have
traveled there in the past 14 days.

Mongolia and 3 regions (Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk Krai, Jewish Autonomous Oblast) in
Far Eastern Federal District, Russia have closed their land borders with China.

Bangladesh. Canada, India. Kazakhstan, Russia, and South Korea are arranging flights

to repatriate their respective citizens from Wuhan. These persons will be closely
monitored and present little threat of onward transmission.

NIH Production to ICAN_000216

All tourist attractions in Tibet Autonomous Region have been closed.

Current influenza vaccination is recommended to decrease the risk of simple influenza
being mistaken for 2019-nCoV upon return.

Infection control supplies have been depleted in medical facilities in the smaller cities in
central China; the situation is critical in many areas and resupply is uncertain.

Overall Risk Assessment

The epidemic in China is months from peaking. A report indicates thatjust prior to the
cordoning off of Wuhan, over 5 million residents (many potentially infectious) left for
other parts of China, and many thousands left for Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and
Japan. Exported cases have so far been to countries likely to be capable of controlling
(but not preventing) ongoing transmission, which will inevitably occur. In light of the
secondary cases in Germany in a business setting. the most cautious approach of
having arrivals stay at home or in a hotel for 14 days after their last poSSible exposure
in China is increasinglyjustifiedt

Based on increasing data on virology, clinical presentation, and transmission, this
coronavirus closely resembles SARS-Cov in many behaviors. Fortunately, sequential
sequencing of viral isolates over time indicates no significant new Viral mutations;
mutations often increase transmission or virulence. WHO assesses the risk of this event
to be very high in China. high at the regional level, and high at the global level. The
closing of Wuhan airport and the maior cities of Hubei province have yet to stem the
flow of exported cases. The originally implicated animal market, now closed indefinitely,
bears little relevance to the ongoing situation. Whether the market was the focus of a
speciesjump from animals to humans or merely one of multiple amplification settings
for initial cases is increasingly unclear, The degree of human-to-human spread outside
ofHubei province remains unclear, A reproductive number, R0, is estimated at 1.4—

2.5 by Chinese authorities and up to 5.5 by other scientists. An Ru greater than i
indicates that each case leads to more than 1 subsequent case, making control much
more difficult. The spectrum of disease manifestations in a large cohort study has yet to
be disclosed a severe case rate of 20% has been consistent. The existence of mildly
symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious cases could increase the risk of global
spread. Case fatality is impossible to ascertain at present. and lesser or greater clinical
virulence compared to MERS—Cov or SARS—CoV remains speculative.

Current Disease Situation

More than 4,600 confirmed cases (976 severe and critical cases and 106 deaths) have
occurred since December 8,2019, in the provinces of Hubei (> 2,700; mainly in
Wuhan], Guangdong (207), Zhejiang (173), Henan (168). Hunan (143). and Anhui
(106); in the cities ofChongqing (132), Beijing (91), and Shanghai (66); and in 21 other
provinces throughout the country. An additional 8,900 suspected cases have been
reported since January 21, 2020. In the setting of a large outbreak and with increased
delays in testing, a high proportion of suspected cases wrll evolve into confirmed cases.
SeventyAnine cases have been discharged. Two-thirds of the cases are male. The
youngest case is 10 years old and the oldest is 89: more than 70% of cases are over 40
years old, but the co-morbidity profiles of most cases are unknown.

The number of persons becoming infected with the virus has been doubling every six
days. The outbreak in China is not approaching peak, and modeling indicates that is
months away.

as short as 3 days.

Entry/Exit Screening

NIH Production to ICAN_000219

In a reversal of long-standing policy, WHO now recommends that all countries
implement temperature screening at points of entry for passengers arriving from 2019-
nCoV—aftected countries. Screening should be accompanied by dissemination of risk-
communication messages at points of entry to later capture asymptomatic persons who
are in the incubation phase.

In early January, some exit screening was implemented at Wuhan Tianhe International
Airport (nonstop ﬂights to Istanbul, London. New York, Osaka, Paris. Rome, San
Francisco, Tokyo, and major hubs throughout Southeast Asia), as well as at 3 major rail
stations in Wuhan. More restrictive screening was instituted on January 15 in Hubei
until cessation of international ﬂights on January 23. Despite exit screening at all
international airpons in China in the past week, significant numbers of cases continue to
be exported.

Entry screening at international ports of entry has been or is being implemented as
noted below. and anyone with Iever and respiratory symptoms who has been to 2019-
nCoV—affected areas in the previous 14 days will be detained and isolated at these
locations:

Algeria. Houari Boumediene Airport, Mohamed Boudiaf International Airport, Oran
Atimed Ben Balla Airport

Internal Travel Restrictions in China: Major cities in Hubei Province have instituted a
travel ban on occupants of their cities, suspending urban buses, subways, ferries, and
long-distance passenger transport from the cities, including ﬂights and trains, and
closing intercity roads. lnterprovince shuttle buses in major areas have stopped. Many
bars, restaurants, shops, and museums are closed in Hubei Province, Guangdong, and
many other affected areas. Majortourist attractions have closed in Beijing, Shanghai,
Sanya (Hainan Province), Hong Kong, and Tibet Autonomous Region, China has
stopped all inbound and outbound tour groups but not individual travel. Internal travel
for the Lunar New Year Holiday has been severely limited by the government, and
public gatherings are forbidden. The reopening of schools and universities has been
postponed in many areas. Shanghai has temporarily closed all nonessential
workplaces. Visitors from Hubei Province will be actively monitored for 14 days in
Haikou, Hainan Province.

No Flights from 2019-nCoV—Affected Countries. Travelers going to Samoa must
spend at least 14 days in a country free of 2019-nCoV and undergo medical clearance
prior to travel to Samoa.

Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, Kalakhstan,
Morocco, Netherlands, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, U.K., and U.S. are
arranging ﬂights to repatriate their respective citizens from Wuhan. These persons will
be closely monitored and present little threat of onward transmission.

Transmission

The detailed epidemiology of possible causative animal exposures and zoonotic
transmission remains unclear. Many (27 of 41 ) earlier cases were directly linked to
South China Seafood City market in Jianghan District. which sold seafood and other
wildlife (including birds) More than 580 environmental samples. without indication as to
whether animal tissue was included, were collected from the implicated market. Of
these, 33 tested positive for 2019»nCoV, indicating that the market was an—or the—origin
point of the large-scale outbreak. Thirty-one ofthe positive samples (94%) were
collected from the western part of the market, where wildlife was traded. The first
published epi-curve shows that the symptom onset date of the first patient identified in
the outbreak was December 1, 2019. The patient reported no exposure to the
implicated market no epidemiological link has been detected between this case and
later cases. This finding raises the possibility of an initial jump of 2019-nCoV directly
from bat to human. with subsequent initial human-to—human propagation within the
seafood market.

Infected intermediate animal hosts, if they exist. may still be present in the supply chain.
South China Seafood City market. now closed indefinitely, remained in operation
through December 31. 2019, Other points of infection would be likely because many
subsequent cases had no contact With the implicated market. Chinese authorities have
now stated that human-to-human transmission is in the fourth generation in Wuhan and
at least the second generation elsewhere (mostly in clusters). A reproductive number.
R0, is estimated at 1.4~2.5by Chinese authorities and at up to 5.5 by some scientists.
Ari Rugreater than 1 indicates that each case leads to more than 1 subsequent case,

making control much more difficult. R0 is not a constant number and changes with the
ongoing circumstances and evolution of an outbreak, One published cluster study
indicates asymptomatic shedding (but not transmission) by a single patient. Sequence
data from several small clusters indicate identical virus in all subjects within the cluster.

NIH Production to ICAN_000222

More than 47,800 close contacts remain under surveillance (> 1,200 have been
released), and contact tracing is ongoing in affected provinces and municipalities.
However. not all contacts are being ascertained or monitored adequately. As many as
16 health care workers (HCWs) have been confirmed as infected by at least 1 case in
Wuhan in a potential super~spreading event, but overall infectivity for HCWs has not
been established. No case of 2019-nCoV has been attributed to transmission on an
aircraft.

The survival rate of the virus on surfaces or in the environment is unknown Disinfection
processes that are effective for other zoonotic coronaviruses should be followed for
now. Clean daily all "high-touch" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs,
bathroom ﬁxtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tables, and bedside tables. Also, clean
any surfaces that may have blood, bodilyﬂuids, and/or secretions or excretions on
them. Use a diluted bleach solution or a household disinfectant with a label that says
"EPA-approved," To make a bleach solution, add 15 mL (1 tablespoon) of bleach to 1 L
(1 quart) of water; for a larger supply, add 60 mL (2 oz) of bleach to 4 L (1 gallon) of
water.

Clinical Manifestations

Most cases have reportedly exhibited symptoms of fever, respiratory compromise, and
bilateral pneumonia with diffuse, ground glass-like infiltrates on chest x-ray or CT scan
Unlike SARS-CoV, upper respiratory illness symptoms (rhinorrhea, sneezing. sore
throat) and diarrhea are not common. Overall, about 20% of the cases have been
severe or critical, including pneumonia. respiratory failure, and in some cases death.
The existence of asymptomatic cases has not been ascertained. No known treatment
eXists for 2019-nCoV, although remdesivir will be available shortly from the US, CDC
for compassionate use, Usual antiviral drugs. including oseltamivir (Tamiflu), baloxavir,
ribaVirin. and acyclovir. are ineffective. Steroids should not be used. Based on earlier
literature, the combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir is under study in China. Current
influenza vaccination is recommended to decrease the risk of simple inﬂuenza being
mistaken for 201 9-nCoV upon return.

In a small cohort of 41 patients (median age was 49 years; intercuartile range: 41 -58)
conducted early in the epidemic (presentation before January 2), the most common
symptoms at onset of illness were fever (98%). cough (76%), and myalgia or fatigue
(44%). Dyspnea developed in 55% of patients at a median of 8 days. All cases except 1
had bilateral pneumonia. Milder cases had chest CTs that showed bilateral ground»
glass opacity With subsegmental areas of consolidation, whereas ICU patients had
bilateral lobar and subsegmental areas of consolidation. Only 66% of cases (even in
this early cohort) had been exposed to the South China Seafood City market. The case-
fatality rate was estimated to be 15%. but more severe cases tend to predominate early
in an epidemic. Limited data from another published cluster study indicate a 3- to 6-day
incubation period similar to SARS—Cov and clinical and radiologic features similar to
SARS»CoV cases in 2003. Another report indicates an incubation period ranging from 1
to 14 days.

Virology
2019-nCoV was initially isolated from 1 case and entirely sequenced: this information

was published internationally by Chinese scientists on January 10. Electron microscopy
of1 specimen demonstrated classic coronavirus particles. 2019-nCoV is the seventh

NIH Production to ICAN_000223

member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Novel coronaviruses frorn
Wuhan, together with 2 bat-derived EARS-like strains, form a distinct clade in lineage B
of the subgenus sarbecovirus. 2019-nCov is a group 2b coronavirus (as are MERS—CoV
and SARS-CoV), with a whole genome similarity of up to 80% to SARS—CoV but with a
similarity between different gene segments ranging from 60% to 90%. 2019~nCOV
exhibits a 86 5% similarity to the known bat coronavirus precursors in the same viral
clade.

Sequence data allowed national laboratories to rapidly develop diagnostic kits. which
are now available in most developed countries and most Asian countries. HKU1‘ NL63,
229E, and 0043 are human coronaviruses that are detected by some routine multiplex
PCR panels used in routine clinical practice. These coronaviruses are associated with
minor upper respiratory infections and viral pneumonia, but unlike SARS-COV, MERS-
00V, and ZOtQ-nCoV, these agents are not associated with major outbreaks or severe
respiratory distress syndrome, 2019-nCoV is not reactive in these tests. The findings so
far strongly favor (but do not prove) causation. 2019-nCoV has been shown to use the
same cell-entry receptor as SARS-CoV. Viral loads appear to be highest in lower
respiratory tract specimens, which should be the primary spedmen obtained. Prediction
of human~lo~huinan transmissibility lrom sequence data is difficult because
coruriaviruses vary widely in theirtransmissibility, curonaviruses acquired from animals
generally have some potential for human-to-human transmission Evidence from
subsequent whole genome sequences acquired over the last several weeks show little
genetic variation, indicating that the virusjumped from an animal reservoir to humans
within the last few months. Identical recent mutations in epidemiologically unlinked
cases support sustained human-to»human transmission.

Criteria for Testing of Suspected Cases

U.S. CDC

Persons meeting the following criteria (clinical features and epidemiologic risk) for
suspected cases of 2019-nCoV will be considered persons under investigation (PUl):

. Fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of
breath) plus a history of travel to Wuhan or close contact with a PUl for 2019-nCoV
while that person was ill in the past 14 days before symptom onset

. Fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough. shortness of
breath) plus close contact with an ill, laboratory-conﬁrmed 2019-nCoV case in the past
14 days before symptom onset

HCWs entering the room with a PUl should use standard precautions, contact
precautions. airborne precautions, and eye protection (e.g.. goggles or a face shield).

PUls for 2019-nCoV should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are
identiﬁed and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne-
infection isolation room if available.

Prevention

Travelers going to Wuhan should avoid animals (alive or dead), animal marketsI
products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat), and contact with ill,
appearing persons. Quality of infection control at medical facilities in Wuhan is
uncertain, and those with minor medical problems should avoid busy medical settings.

NIH Production to ICAN_000224

Infection control supplies have been depleted in medical facilities in the smaller cities in
central China; the situation is critical in many areas and resupply is uncertain. Travelers
who develop fever and respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travel to Wuhan should
immediately be isolated, and public health authorities should be alerted.

Employees, Students, Visitors, All Others Coming from Wuhan

Whether asymptomatic individuals infected with 2019-nCoV are infectious to others is
unknown. Inﬂuenza viruses can be transmitted 1 to 2 days prior to symptom onset.
SARS»CoV did not transmit until 4 days after symptom onset, which led to its
eradication because all contacts with fever could be promptly identified and isolated.

If 2019-nCoV is similar to SARS~COV, asymptomatic arrivals from Wuhan should self<
monitor by taking a temperature reading immediately prior to coming into the workplace
or school for 14 days after their last exposure in Wuhan. Arrivals with teverat any time
should self-report to public health authorities (or telephone ahead before presenting to
a hospital) and should wear a mask as soon as possible. A more stringent approach
would require that an employee, student, or visitop—upon arrival to a workplace or
schoolibe instructed to perform an additional temperature check in the presence of
medical personnel to ensure compliance with local self‘monitoring requirements. In
addition, prior to any gathering ofe 2 persons. attendees could be required to perform
additional self-monitoring,

Based on advanced information and employee or visitor medical screening, additional
preventive measures may be required (e.q., increased ventilation, larger meeting rooms
with more personal space per participant, disinfection of work areas and lavatories, and
provision of alcohol wipes).

The most cautious approach would be for arrivals to stay at home or in a hotel for 14
days aftertheir last possible exposure in China. To date, all known cases exported to
other countries had eithervisited Wuhan or had contact with an ill person from Wuhan
while in China.

Subject: touching base about Texas Biomedical Research Institute
Hi Tony and Hugh.

I know that I am writing to you at a busy time during yet another infectious disease
outbreak that is rapidly evolving. However, i wanted to send you a brief note to update
you about the transformational change going on in the landscape of our free standing
institute with its new, sharply defined goal to be the global leader in eradicating
infectious disease threats in the world. I know that you are familiar with us.

l have been leading the institute since June of 2017 and currently ﬁnishing year one of a
10 year board-approved plan of growth in our scientists, educational programming and
campus modernization. I believe that you are aware that we house the only private
BSL4. We also just opened our newest of 5 BSL3 facilities, this newest one being nearly
8000 sq. ft. with capacity for ~100 NHPs, small animals, a complete aerosol suite and a
PET CT. We also house the SNPRC, now under the leadership of Deepak Kaushal
(who replaced Robert Lanford) and with the largest marmoset colony as a result of
restructuring our buildin facilities in addition to our other species .

    

Please check out our newly designed website: www.txbiomed.org.

The bottom line is that I left university life to lead an organization that is determined to
not only discover critical, new fundamental science but also effectively and efficiently
bring it full forward to create portfolios for the FDA through our business model,
nimbleness, regulated science culture (GLP level), longstanding public and private
partners through contract science (esp. BARDA), culture and community support.

NIH Production to ICAN_000229 ””2143

We want to help! Please let us know if and how we can contribute to this outbreak and
undoubtedly others going forward.

I truly appreciate your leadership. The country gets the voice of reason on infectious
disease outbreaks through your public efforts. I enjoyed learning more about this during
my time on council

Best,

Larry

Subject: Potential Approach to Wuhan Coronavirus

Dear Dr. Faucir
You likely do not recall meeting me when J was looking at potential fellowships in 1978, however. 1 never forgot
your enthusiasm. I went out to San Diego and worked with Mike Uldstone. between 1979 and 1984.
1 did study a mouse coronavirus while there, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). 1 focused on generic resistance, and
eventually described a mouse locus fol susceptibility. vihieh coded for the MHV receptor
Lacking the correct receptor m'blocking binding ot‘the virns spike protein to the teccptot‘ with monoclonal
antibodies blocked infection.
Onto the present problem ofhuman coronaviruses. Vnceines will take a long time for the current crisis. The
angiotensin convening enzyme 2 receptor has been identiﬁed as the relevant human coronavirus receptor in earlier
studies of SARS and MERS human coronavirus outbreaks I am writing to suggest the investigation of ARHs as
pntentlal blocking agents to either reduce or completely block infection, Perhaps this can be checked it'cnrrect,
there may still be sufﬁcient untainted supplies ot‘ARBs. such as lrbesartan, available. or production can be scaled
up. ifthis tmly ls the eve ofa pandemic
Wishing you success in this endeavors lam willing to contribute in any way 1 can. Please feel free to Contact lne by
email or my cell phone
I also did do clinical trials uhilc vlith Mike and then when i joined the neurology faculty oflefferson in
Philadelphia I have been out on my own since December 1998‘ butI have never lost my lntercht in this work. For
another time, 1 also have some novel ideas on how HlV becomes AIDSi as well. Ironically. these ideas were based
upon observations I iii-aide during my analysis of MHV.
All the Best,

Subject: Dr Levitt summarizes CDC 20:97nCoV Committee Report released today 5 Feb 2020
Dear Secretary Azar and Dr. Fauci,

I have read carefully the CDC's report issued this morning on the Wuhan virus lZOlQ-nCoV)
epidemic originating in Wuhan, Hubei Provmce, PRC. The Report was prepared by CDC's best
Ph.D,s, M.D,s, and D,V.M,s See the pdf attached above for the complete report.

Below 1 have recorded what I think the most important facts in the report for Secretary Azar
and other federal officials who must stop the spread of 2019»nCoV in the US. by identifying all
infected persons and their contacts I have also added my personal thoughts on how to stop
the spread of this novel coronavirus and a personal fear I have communicated to Secretary Azar
in the past:

W President Trump signed an order preventing entry into the US. of any person who has
traveled to mainland China (PRC). Exceptions include US. citizens and permanent residents and
their families. Thank you Mr. Trump.

~ CDC maintains an office in the PRC. So information from Wuhan, Hubei, PRC, should be ‘real
time',

-— Enhanced screening of persons entering the US. is taking place at 18 ports and 5 airports.
The number of ports and especially airports needs to be increased. The Report states that
14,000 Chinese enter the US, daily. if the 5 airports receive 85% of these Chinese, then 2,100
Chinese enter the us. daily at other airports without enhanced screening.

-- CDC has developed Its own RT—PCR test to detect 2019-nCoV In respiratory specimens. I have read
case reports where state laboratories have required too much proof of suspected Wuhan virus from
clinicians before performing RT-PCR testing ofspecimens. CDC should provide their improved RT-PCR
test to all states and HHS should insure that all states have sufﬁcient equipment and trained
personnel for rapid turn-around time.

NIH Production to ICAN_000235 ”WWW

~ CDC has grown the 2019-nCoV virus. CDC should expedite distribution of the grown virus to
researchers with verified credentials and vetting in a safe and monitored procedure.

-— CDC recommends that persons suspected by clinicians of having 2019-nCoV be placed in a
separate room with a N95 face mask so that they are not in range of other patients. HCW
should wear personal protection: gloves, gown, face shield or N95 mask and goggles.

  

7* Cli 'cians have identified 8 of the current 11 patients infected with 2019rnCoV in the U.S,
CDC is doing a terrificjob in getting the message out to clinicians and the public.

and evolution of ZOIBn-COV”
0 They have asked for names to sit on that Group— please do send any names

0 We can have a call this week with a core group of that to frame the work of the Group

0 I think this puts it under the umbrella of WHO, with action this week and into next
0 With names to be put forward into the Groupfrom us and pressure on this group from

Greetings Patty and Tony -- | see you on TV constantly guiding us through the terrain on our
preparedness for outbreaks such as what we have seen in China. I want to see ifl can add one more
request to your pile to think about....and lam trying to see if what I am suggesting might work right
before your Aspen talk next Tuesday at noon

In addition to my great role at The Hill. I am host ofa new show called "The Bottom Line" on Al Jazeera
English that runs four times a week on their global network and is garnering between look-200k VIEWS a
week on YouTube in the US. The show is doing really well and is a 24 minute panel discussion of three
experts on a single topic that I facilitate, I would love to have you, Tony, be the anchor commentator on
what we should do not only on the coronavirus but in general on the infrastructure of pandemic
preparedness in the country -» sort ofa shorter form of that great PBS show you did called Invisible
Killers.

We would want to tape in our studio at let and M Streets NW from 11:00 am - 11:30 am (we don't go
over), or I could move It 15 to 30 minutes earlier if you like next Tuesday, 11 Februaw. I know you have
to be at Aspen at noon (l was invited too) -- so I could take you if you like.

I realize that this may be too much . —- but in these times, I think it's important to get smart commentary

and analysis out there -- and I think I can add a couple hundred thousand eyeballs and ears to the

millions you are already reaching. The producers are also able to provide car and driver “119

Hope this might work my friend. I may send a short form of this to your cell phone.
Call me if you want to chat, either of you, at {19%.

Dear Dr Anthony S Fauci,
This is Zacharyfrom BBC Chinese.

I am now writing a piece regarding the treatment of people in isolation or quarantine over coronavirus
in different countries.

Most of the countries told the public where the people evacuated from Wuhan reside for quarantine
and some drew local's protests. They expressed concern over close vicinity and some even went to
protest in these places.

Others like Taiwan, the authority decided to keep the quarantine location confidential. The reason is to
avoid unnecessary worrisome and let people rest well.

I would like to have an interview with you by e-mail or Skype phone with you to give some insights or
comments on this issue

If you could be quoted, the questions are as below

1. Why does the government tell the public the quarantine location? Is it necessary? Or why not?

NIH Production to ICAN_000247 "mow"

2. Many residents protested because they don’t want the quarantine Center for Coronavirus in their
neighborhood Do they need to worry about it?

3. What is your suggestion regarding the location of quarantine those people from Wuhan. And what
is essential for Quarantine Center for Coronavirus?

Thank you very much for your time.

Respected Dr Anthony

It was great to know about you and your institution, for efforts in combating any emerging infectious
disease.

I am writing this email regarding our preliminary observation about the coronavirus genome.

IWIsh to share with you we have found 12 mirror DNA sequence within the genome of Coronavirus. We
have named it (MR1 to MR12). We are highly interested in MR2 as this mirror DNA sequence is absent

in the human genome. —

IWIsh to add here there are few studies which state that mirror DNA has the potentiality to form H-DNA
and later has a potentiality to induce mutations. We strongly believe a future study on mirror DNA can
answer " Why some virus mutates faster ?" "Can we stop them from mutating? —

—
— I will be thankful to you, If you can give me your valuable
time to discuss telephonically or through skype our ideas, I can be reached at_.

I look forward to hearing from you,

with regards and Best wishes

Transmission is definitely by respiratory droplet. Still unclear about aerosol
transmission although there are anecdotal reports that this occurs similar to what
we saw in individual episodes with SARS back in 200272003. Almost certainly
contact transmission occurs with hand to mucosa (mouth, eyes, nasal mucosa).
Unclear about fomites, doorknobs, etc. Virus can live for a couple of hours on
certain inanimate objects. Virus definitely isolated from stool and urine, but not
sure of role in transmission. No information about Transmission to fetus.
Children have very low rate of infection. No good serologic test at this point
although they are rapidly being developed.

-Sneeze orcough produces respiratory droplet or aerosolized respiratory secretion which make contract
with upper or lower respiratory mucosa, which results in infection of human cells. Seems most likely.

- What about contact transmission, contaminated hand to conjunctivae, nasal mucosa, or mouth

, Fecal/oral

- transmission to fetus

-What are the diagnostic tests to confirm diagnosis of novel coronavirus? PCR of secretions? Who in the
world has these test kit; who manufactures kit.

-Are follow up serologies begin done?

Interesting questions to us and to Shelly Wolf if he were with us.

Julia:

The appearance of community transmissions in Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran is
troublesome. As I have repeatedly said over the past couple of weeks, if and when (looks more
like when now] a number of other countries besides China have sustained human to human
transmissions, then we are on the brink of a pandemic, if not alreadythere. The reason to say
this is that when several countries have widespread transmission, then spill-over to other
countries is inevitable since one cannot shut out the rest of the world and so you can expect
increasing world-wide transmissions. Hence, you will be experiencing a pandemic, We are not
quite there yet, but we are getting disturbingly close.

I hope that this is helpful.

Best,
Tony

Dear Dr. Fauci,
Just over a week ago we talked forthis story about how the outbreak is likely larger than we know now:

outbreak-singagore- ‘-symgtoms-gandernic

Given the developments in Singapore, Iran, Italy, and on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, l'mjust
wondering how your opinion about the possibility of containment and how fast we are approaching a

pandemic has changed. Do these developments suggest we’ve entered a new phase in the outbreak?

If you have a few minutes to chat or email today, let me know. We’ll be aiming to run a story on this
today.

Thank you for considering.

Ted:

Thanks for the note. Since she is 22 days out of Singapore she would be well beyond the 14
day quarantine used for people who are coming out of risk zones. And so although her risk is
never zero, it is really very low. If she were coming from Japan or South Korea, which are
experiencing an emerging outbreak, I might feel a little different, but Singapore has good
infection control despite the number of cases in that country Given her history of recent
Shingrix vaccination, I would wait another day to see if her fever breaks. 1 agree thatl would
keep her at home for now. i do notthink it would come to that, but if you want to get testing
done, it still would have to go to the CDC via the Virginia department of health. Bottom line is
that I would sit tight for now and see how she does over the next day or so. Ifthings change,
do not hesitate to call or e-mail me.

Subject: Covid—19 question

Hi Tony,

The Wife ofone of my patients received the Shingrix vaccine on Thursday 2/20 and developed
feverto 101.4 the following day with malaise, headache, mild nausea (no respiratory
symptoms). She's taken ibuprofen with transient temperature reduction; the fever and
symptoms are the same today.

BUT. . . she and her daughter were in Singapore (“N“) where they stayed at the
00(5), visited 00(5) and the 00(5). They then flew to
Colombo, Sri Lanka before returning Via Europe last 99(5) to 00(5)” So her

fever began 3 weeks plus 1 day after being in Singapore.

I've told her to keep treating the fever and symptoms but to stay at home for now. The fever
after Shingrix usually resolves after 23 days so I‘d expect it to abate today or tomorrow. My
question is whether there's enough of a concern, viz. the time in Singapore, for her to be tested
for covid719. If so, what‘s the best way to conduct the testing? Or is it okay to see if herfever
breaks by tomorrow?

(You must be getting lots of these questions).

Best,
Ted

Drt Fauci; I attended a small water seminar, put on by local (Seventh Day Adventist) medical profes-
sionals, in the mid 1970's at Elms Haven, California.

This seminar taught the participants how to eliminate the flu with the use of water treatments, ie
(steam baths, etc).

I have now for these past 40 some-odd years, been taking two treatment's; one in the evening and
another in the middle of the night, wheneverl have contacted the flu: AND have had the facilities to do
so; and each time I was well the next morning. No temperature, no symptoms whatsoever.

With the high rate that this Coronavirus is spreading, one can see what a great tool these treatments
can be for medical professionals. To have those who are sick with the flu, completely free of all
symptoms after two treatments would greatly ease the burden on Dr's and other medical professionals
AND each facility.

Washington, DC. Here is the link to the overall CUGH meeting which provides an
overview of the whole conference htt s: www.cu h2020.or ro ram. As we
discussed months ago you agreed to be in the opening day plenary session on

April 18th, entitled ”Emerging Infectious Diseases and their Impact on Global
Health Security”. The details and other speakers are listed below. I may try to
organize a call of all speakers in a month to coordinate talks/topics as the session
is 90 minutes with 5 speakers, and a lot of ground to cover, especially with the
COVID19 outbreak.

Judy Wasserheit, copied here, would also like to invite you to a special session she
is organizing on the coronavirus epidemic at the same CUGH conference in a late-
breaker session on Sunday, April 19 (the second day of the conference) from
8:45am710:15am at the Washington Hilton Hotel {Monroe Room). This talk would
be slightly different from the plenary session and you could expand on COVIDIB
research priorities and update on progress. We realize your schedule is very
busy but your insights and knowledge on both of these topics is unparalleled. If
you cannot speak at the second session we would appreciate your
recommendation as to an alternative who could address this latter topic.

Thanks and all the best,

Plenag Session Details:

Session Day: Saturday, April 18, 2020

Session Time: 11:30am-1200pm

Location: Washington Hilton Hotel, International Ballroom

Panel Title: "Emerging Infectious Diseases and their Impact on Global Health
Security”

Short Panel Description: This Plenary Panel will highlight the continual threats of
emerging and reeemerging infectious diseases, and their impact on global security
for surveillance, detection, treatment and prevention of these diseases. Over
recent decades, multiple epidemic events have underscored how highly
vulnerable we are to viral threats. Our world is globally connected—and an
"emerging threat" in one part ofthe world can pose a threat everywhere and to
everyone. About 75 percent of new human diseases are caused by microbes that
originate in animals. These include HlV, influenza (including pandemic H1N1,
H5N1, and H7N9), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome—Coronavirus (MERS-Cov), Ebola, Marburg, and Nipah. The
recent emergence of COVID from China clearly illustrates the magnitude, rapidity

NIH Production to ICAN_000270

and impact that a new infectious agent can have on global health security. This
panel of leading experts will discuss the emergence of these microbial threats,
and our ability to detect, respond and prevent future epidemics ofthese
pathogens.

Organization: Greek newspaper To VIMA (www.mvirnagr)
Phone #(s): 00(5), thtsoli@tovima.gr

Subject: COVlD-19

Deadline: Monday 2/24

The reporter emailed questions for ASP. I have drafted proposed responses for his
review, also attached.

1. Do you believe that SARS-COVZ is capable of causing a pandemic? Are
you expecting many secondary transmissions of the virus outside China?
A pandemic is generally defined as sustained transmission ofa new pathogen in
multiple regions of the world. COVlD-19 does not yet meet that definition, and I
hope that China and other countries in Asia with some transmission are able to
contain the outbreak. However, it is possible that COVID-19 could become a
pandemic. It would not be surprising to see additional secondary transmissions of
the virus outstde of China.

2. Chinese authorities are reporting a decline of new cases. Could we say that
the virus has peaked and maybe it will slow down? When are you expecting
to have a clearer picture about the evolution of this epidemic?

Although the number of daily cases in China appears to have gone down, it is
too early to tell if this is really a decline in the outbreak.

3. Could the virus become endemic and give seasonal outbreaks?
If China is not able to contain the outbreak, it is possible COVID-19 could
become endemic and lead to seasonal outbreaks. However, it is too early to
know the likelihood of this scenario.

4. What about its transmissibility? Some experts say that WHO is
underestimating it's transmissibility. Could the reality be different maybe
because, among other things, many cases stay undetected?

Because of the many unknowns about SARS-CoV-Z, it is difficult to make any
firm conclusions regarding overall transmissibility and severity. However, it
appears to be much more transmissible than SARS. Also, there are likely
asymptomatic COVlD-19 infections that are not getting counted because people
do not go to the doctor for testing or treatment if they are not sick.

NIH Production to ICAN_000275 "'"001636

5. Do you believe that the measures taken by China and countries around the
world are adequate to stop SARS-COVZ spread? There is a lot of
discussion about thermal cameras and travel restrictions for example.
China has taken extreme measures to control the outbreak. Restricting the
movement of 50 million people is unprecedented However, it might ultimately
have an effect on slowing transmission. Precautions implemented in the US. are
not intended to detect every person with COVlD-19 entering the country.
However, our approach has allowed us time to better plan and prepare our health
system.

6 What is the key to stop the worldwide spread of the virus?
Though we have mobilized a rapid research response to quickly develop
effective countermeasures, right now the outbreak response remains focused on
the proven public health practices of identifying cases, isolating patients and
tracing contacts.

7 In the northern hemisphere we have a flu outbreak - in Greece as well.
Some experts say that this is the real danger and not the coronavirus. What
is your view?

I am always concerned about influenza. Every flu season, millions of people are
at risk of getting very sick or dying. Currently people in the US. and most
countries in the northern hemisphere are at a much higher risk of being exposed
to inﬂuenza than SARS—CoV-Z. However, the COVlD-19 outbreak is an evolving
situation and we are treating it as a very serious public health threat.

8 Many efforts are being in process for the development of a vaccine for the
new coronavirus. Are you coordinating any of them and which ones? Are
there any efforts more promising than others? Which platforms of vaccine
development are more promising? When do you believe that we could have
a vaccine available for clinical trials and then for human use?

NIAID is exploring multiple candidates and is on track to test an experimental
messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine in a Phase 1 clinical trial this spring. This first
phase of clinical testing will involve giving the vaccine to healthy adults in the
United States to see if it is safe and if it can induce an immune response in
reCipients. It is important to realize that the development of investigational
vaccines and the clinical testing to establish their safety and effectiveness takes
time. A vaccine against the novel coronavirus will likely not be widely available
for more than a year.

9. What about therapies? Dozens are being tried -from plasma to herbal
medicines in China. Which are the most promising?
NIAID is pursuing the development of antivirals and monoclonal antibodies for
potential use against COVlD-19. NiAID is preparing protocols for in vitro and in
vivo studies of the antiViral remdesivir, which has shown promise against other
ooronaviruses in animal models. NIAID also plans to evaluate Kaletra
(Iopinavirlritonavir) and interferon-beta for their activity against SARS-CoV-Z. In
addition, NIAID scientists are working to identify monoclonal antibodies with

NIH Production to ICAN_000276

therapeutic potential from stored SARS patient samples as well as COVID-19
patient samples.

10. Are the things we know about this new virus more than the ones we don't
know? Which are the main questions about it that remain to be answered?
New data are published about SARS-CoV-Z every day. However, we still have a
lot to learn. For example, we do not know why there are so few cases among

children, which is uncommon for a respiratory virus.

11. How worried should people outside China be about SARS-COVZ? What is
the biggest danger from this Virus?
. The risk to the general American public remains low at this time; however, this
could change and that Is why we are treatlng the emergence of a novel
coronavirus as a very serious public health threat. We understand that
people may be worried. We ask that people not let fear or panic guide their
actions.

12. Which are the protective measures anyone should take against the new
virus? Do masks work?
The vast majority of people outside of China do not need to wear a mask. A
mask is more appropriate for someone who is infected than for people trying to
protect against infection.

HHS Engages Sanofi’s Recombinant
Technology for 2019 Novel Coronavirus
Vaccine

Racing to develop a vaccine against the 2019 novel coronavirus, the US. Department of
Health and Human Services' Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and
Response has engaged Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines global business unit of Sanofi.

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDAl, a component of
ASPR, will provide expertise and reallocated funds to support the vaccine’s development.
Sanofi will use its egg-free, recombinant DNA platform to produce a recombinant 2019
novel coronavirus vaccine candidate.

The technology produces an exact genetic match to proteins of the Virus, The protein’s
DNA will be combined with DNAfrom a virus harmless to humans, and used to rapidly
produce large quantities of antigen which stimulate the immune system to protect against
the Virus, The antigens will be separated and collected from these cells and purified to
create working stocks of vaccine for advanced development.

“Flexibility and scalability are cornerstones of rapid response to an emerging infectious
disease,” said BARDA Director RickA. Bright, PhD. ”Using this proven technology, we can
pivot immediately to address this new global health threat. Our goal is a licensed vaccine
to provide long-term health security against this latest virus and prevent future
coronavirus outbreaks."

BARDA has worked with Sanofi since 2004 and in 2009 began collaborating with Protein
Sciences of Meridian, Connecticut, now owned by Sanofi, to develop a recombinant
technology with the flexibility to make millions of doses of vaccine quickly in an influenza
pandemic. In 2016, BARDA added this vaccine to the US. National Pre-pandernic Influenla
Vaccine Stockpile. When Sanofi purchased the companyand its technology in 2017, BARDA
continued working with Sanofi on pandemic vaccine development, and in December 2019
the partners began focusing on increasing manufacturing capacity for recombinant
inﬂuenza vaccine in the United States, in accordance with a presidential executive order to
enhance national security and the public health by modernizing influenza vaccines and
technologies.

This expanded collaboration with Sanofi is BARDA's second program to focus on
developing a novel coronavirus vaccine candidate in the past few weeks. There is currently
no approved vaccine, treatment, or diagnostic for novel coronavirus infections; however,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to
enable emergency use of a diagnostic test developed by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.

BARDA also is working with counterparts across the government, including within HHS and
with the Department of Defense. The team is reviewing potential vaccines, treatments and
diagnostics from across the public and private sectors, particularly products in
development for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) or Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS), to identify promising candidates for development and licensure to
detect, protect against or treat novcl coronavirus infections.

To obtain information about any potential products in development in the private sector
that could be used in responding to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the US. government

NIH Production to ICAN_000279

launched a single point-of—entry website for innovators and product developers to submit
brief descriptions of their diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, and other products or
technologies relevant to this new virus.
Federal agencies are particularly interested in identifying products and technologies that
have progressed into or beyond non»clinical studies, have established large-scale
commercial Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing capability, and/or have
utilized a platform alreadyapproved by the U S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
BARDA also opened :in easy broad agency announcement, an EZVBAA specificto
diagnostics that utilize platforms already cleared bythe FDA, with a viable plan to meet
requirements for the FDA to consider Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) within 12 weeks
of an award.

Dear Drs Wu, Brooks, Baric, and Fauci:

It is more than incredibly impressive at how all of you, in just the past few days, have rearranged your
schedules and agreed to participate in this special session in only about 2 weeks. We are all very
grateful, and know this will be tremendously impactful for the CROl audience.

Below is the final list of presentations, although the order and titles may well change. We are hoping to
have a conference call with the session liaisons and speakers next week if possible, to go over each of
the talks to address the overall plan and discuss any overlap. Shortly we will send out a poll for
availability for early morning in China, early-mid afternoon in the US West Coast, and late afternoon—

evening In the US East Coast. If you can respond to the poll by Monday we would greatly appreciate It;
things are moving quickly.

Many thanks again,

All of us at CROI!

we think that there is a possibility that the virus was released from a lab in wuhan, the
biotech area of china. we also thinkthat the virus might be complexed with another organism, such as a
yeast or fungus, to make it more sticky,

Dear D. Fauci,

I want to suggest that NlAlD arrange to collect serum samples from Coronavirus patients who
have survived a major infection and probably have generated antiviral antibodies, My

a powerful technology called Phage Display. The project could be initiated in this country with

Dear Dr Fauci:
We've had a lot ofdiscussion around our COVIDrlQ session today. An idea that came up was possibly
having you do something remotely. Either alive feed in from your office at approximately 1:05 PM to

1:20 PM EDT on Tuesday, March 10 ifyou have that time available, or have you send in a video recorded
presentation a day or 2 before that we can show at the session. Having some way to communicate the

NIH Production to ICAN_000320 ”Mums

high priority NIH/NIAlD has on developing a vaccine and treatment would help bring the content
together.

We know this is likely not possible, with the very short notice and your even more tremendously busy
schedule around all of this. But it’s worth the ask.

Please let me know if you think either of these is possible. And Patty, sorry for butchering your email

CROI, It will be on Tuesday, March 10, during the lunch break; the initial general structure will be a 10-
to 15» minute overview (CDC), a 25-min talk by Ralph Barac (UNC) about the virology of coronaviruses,
and a 10- to 15-minute summary on what NIAID/NIH is doing and planning. We thought that this being

one of the first large medical conferences in infectious diseases this year, that we address COVID 19 at
CROI

We know that this is terribly last minute, but the CROl Chairs and Foundation are hoping you are free to
give the NIAID/NIH update. CROI is in Boston, March 8 to 11.

If you think you would be able to do this, we will send a more formal communication with details and
work with Pattyon the specifics. Thank you so much Dr Fauci; we hope you will be able to join us,

Importance: High

 

Dear Dr Fauci:

We've had a lot ofdiscussion around our COVlDelS session today. An idea that came up was possibly
having you do something remotely. Either a live feed in from your office at approximately 1:05 PM to
1:20 PM EDT on Tuesday, March 10 if you have that time available, or have you send in a video recorded
presentation a day or 2 before that we can show at the session. Having some way to communicate the
high priority NIH/NIAlD has on developing a vaccine and treatment would help bring the content
together.

We know this is likely not possible, with the very short notice and your even more tremendously busy
schedule around all of this. But it’s worth the ask.

Please let me know if you think either of these is possible, And Patty, sorry for butchering your email
address earlier.

Best,

Donna

Dear Dl’ Fauci:

As I mentioned on the phone, we just today decided that we will have a special session on COVID 19 at
CROI. It will be on Tuesday, March 10, during the lunch break; the initial general structure will be a 10-

to 15- minute overview (CDC), a 25-min talk by Ralph Barac (UNC) about the virology of coronaviruses,

and a 10— to 15—minute summary on what NIAID/NIH is doing and planning. We thought that this being
one of the first large medical conferences in infectious diseases this year, that we address COVID 19 at

CROI

We know that this is terribly last minute, but the CROl Chairs and Foundation are hoping you are free to
give the NIAID/NIH update. CROI is in Boston, March 8 to 11.

If you think you would be able to do this, we will send a more formal communication with details and
work with Patty on the specifics. Thankyou so much Dr Fauci; we hope you will be able to join us.

Best,

During one call, the CDC’s principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, argued against
taking the infected Americans on the plane, according to two participants. She noted the
US. government had already told passengers they would not be evacuated with anyone
who was infected or showed symptoms. She was also concerned about infection control.
Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who
was also on the calls, recalled saying her points were valid and should be considered.
But Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response for the
Department of Health and Human Services and a member of the coronavirus task force,
pushed back: Ofﬁcials had already prepared the plane to handle passengers who might
develop symptoms on the long ﬂight, he argued. The two Boeing 747s had 18 seats
cordoned off with 10-foot-high plastic on all four sides. Infectious disease doctors would
also be onboard.

Story contains these crucial grafs:

In Washington, where it was still Sunday afternoon, a ﬁerce debate
broke out: The State Department and a top Trump administration
health official wanted to forge ahead. The infected passengers had no
symptoms and could be segregated on the plane in a plastic-lined
enclosure. But officials at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention disagreed, contending they could still spread the virus.
The CDC believed the 14 should not be ﬂown back with uninfected
passengers.

“It was like the worst nightmare,” said a senior U.S. official involved
in the decision, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe
private conversations. “Quite frankly, the alternative could have
been pulling grandma out in the pouring rain, and that would have
been bad, too.”

It is impossible to predict at this point if the current outbreak will progress to a
true pandemic. The future of this outbreak and whether it will progress to a
pandemic will be determined by two factors: 1) the degree to which China
controls infections in China, which will ultimately impact how many infections
leak out to other countries in the world. 2) The success or not of other countries
that have received travel-related cases from China in preventing the development
of sustained transmission of infections in their own country. lfthese other
countries are successful in containing the transmissions, then a pandemic will be
avoided. If a large number of countries are unsuccessful in preventing sustained
multi-generation transmissions, then we could witness the next pandemic.

Joel:

There are many iterations of the definition of a “pandemic". However, one
that I use that is simple and understandable is as follows: An outbreak ofa
serious infectious disease with substantial global health consequences (usually
one that has never before been experienced by the human population) that is
transmitted readily from person to person and where there is sustained
transmission (i.e. multiple generations of person to person to person) in multiple
countries and regions of the world. In this regard, the coronavirus outbreak in
China is an ”epidemic" in China, but it is not yet a pandemic since there is not
“sustained" person to person transmission throughout the world. There are
infections in other countries (more than 25 countries), but these started as travel
related cases from China and although there are several human to human
infections in these other countries, these infections have not yet been
”sustained”. If we start seeing sustained, multiple generations of transmissions
in many countries throughout the world, then the outbreak will have progressed
to fill the criteria of a true pandemic.

Hope that this is helpful.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the earth, there have been 73,000
cases of coronavirus and more than 2000 deaths. This leaves American
health experts hoping that the number of infections has been dramatically
underreported.

That is not a typo. If the current numbers are close to accurate, it
indicates a coronavirus mortality rate upwards of 2 percent. The morality
rate for the seasonable ﬂu is generally .1 percent. The mortality rate for
pandemic ﬂu is .3 percent. The particularly deadly ﬂu pandemic of 1918 —

NIH Production to ICAN_000340 ”MW”

which took the lives of more than 100 million people around the world —
had a mortality rate of 1.8 to 2 percent.

So, if 2000 deaths is the numerator, scientists hope that the
denominator is actually much larger. And that is probable, given the
likelihood that there are many more people who have the infection but
don’t know it, or are not showing symptoms.

The good news? The outbreak started in a single location and seems
largely contained there. There have been several hundred cases in more
than 25 countries outside of China. But the overwhelming majority have
been travel related. The containment measures of Singapore, Hong Kong
and Japan — which have the most cases — seem to have been successful. Of
the 15 American cases (before the arrival of the cruise ship passengers), 13
are travel related. The two others are spouses of people in that group. We
still have not seen widespread, sustained transmission from person to
person outside of China.

The Chinese reaction to the virus has shown the weaknesses and
advantages of authoritarianism. The immediate response of a system built
on fear is to a problem like this one is denial and deception. No one wants
to carry bad news. So local Chinese officials spent the ﬁrst week of the
outbreak — as the disease was spreading under the radar — insisting that the
transmission of the virus was all animal to human.

But only in a society like China could you have the effective loekdown
of 50 million people, including the entire city of Wuhan, to slow the spread
of the disease. Public health officials in most places — who are required to
balance health needs with civil liberties — would not even consider such a
measure. Yet it appears to be working.

The danger? “All that is needed is for a few countries in the
developing world that can’t contain the coronavirus,” Tony Fauci told me.
“This could be the second wave of the pandemic.”

Pandemic diseases tend to attack the weakest links — the most
vulnerable health systems 7 in the global chain. If there is sustained
transmission in those places, says F auci, “even countries with best practices
will suffer.” Countries in Africa are of particular concern. There are millions
of Chinese in Africa, and many Africans study in China. Countries such as
Ethiopia, Senegal and South Africa seem to be doing a good job at testing
random samples for coronavirus in key cities. But Liberia? Guinea? Sierra
Leone?

Seldom has there been a stronger argument for American global
engagement to strengthen African health systems, which constitute part of
own immune system against pandemics. Seldom has there been a better

NIH Production to ICAN_000341

argument to abandon “America First” posturing and to recognize that our
own fate is closely tied to the fate of other nations.

Much about the future course of the disease depends on the answer to
a scientific question: Is someone who has the virus but lacks symptoms — or
has symptoms so mild they hardly notice — capable of transmitting the
Virus to others? “It looks like the answer is yes,” says Fauci. Which would
make the Virus far harder to control,

“We may ﬁnd that the Virus is highly transmissible, but less lethal
than we thought in the beginning," Fauci told me. In this case, the danger
would be similar to a particularly bad inﬂuenza. And the outbreaks could be
seasonal, like the ﬂu as well. “I would not be surprised if that happened,”
Fauci concluded.

Dear Dr Fauci,

Thanks so much for being who you are and for dedicating your
life to protecting all of us. I write because I saw your interview
on PBS tonight and had a question pertaining to denominators
and numerators. Please know that I profess absolutely no
expertise in areas pertaining to biology nor medicine nor disease
and while I understood and agree With your estimation that the
fatality rate of the Corona Virus to date may be somewhat
inﬂated of the number of cases is understated, I have a related

NIH Production to ICAN_000343 ”MW"

question for you regarding info I was able to ﬁnd at this
site httgszllwwwworldometers.info/coronavirus/

Regarding data this site reports, among many things, and as
one scrolls down, that the 'number of active cases‘ reported
today is 57,228 and the number of these that are ‘serious or
critical' is 12,064. In a worst case scenario, and taking the
12,064 as the numerator and dividing it by a denominator of
57,228, we get 21.08, or about 21%, much higher that the 1%
based on total deaths over total cases so far. Of course this is not
fair but my question is this: can we know better how many of
the patients (cases) who are 'serious or critical' and still being
treated will recover?

Thanks much for any reply—

Dear Tony,

It has been some time since we last spoke, but this current
catastrophe has provoked my thinking about possible
therapeutic interventions that could be immediately
employed —- in advance of therapies/vaccines that will take

many months to create. And I need to share those
thoughts with you.

My suggestion is to treat actively—infected, and acutely ill,

resulting GVHD response should theoretically combat, and

Importance: ngh

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Ihope all is well. BioCentury is doing a roundup of companies and institutions developing antibodies
against the SARS-Con2 virus to treat patients with COVlD—19. Since you told my colleague Steve Usdin
NlAlD is developing its own mAbs against the virus, we’d like to include information about that program

in our roundup.

Would you or one of your colleagues be able to answer the following questions? Any information you
could share by 5 PM Pacific Time on Thursday. Feb. 20 would be greatly appreciated.

1. Are your mAb candidates being developed against specific targets on SARS£oV-2? if so, what
are those targets?

2. What platforms or processes are you using to identify mAb candidates?

3. Do you have multiple mAb programs against SARS»CoV-2 proceeding in parallel, and ifso, how
are they distinguished?

NIH Production to ICAN_000351 "'Mu‘737

4. What is that status of each of your mAb programs? For example, have you nominated any lead
candidates, are you awaiting patient samples, etc?

5. Do you have any metrics on lead candidates available yet, such as neutralization titers? If so,
what are they?

All the best,
Karen

Dear Dr. Fauci,

On behalf of the World Bank health team, in coordination with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness
Innovations (CEPI), it is our pleasure to invite you to a halfaday consultation on Financing Coronal/has
Disease 2019 (CDVID-19) Vaccine Development. The meeting is set to take place on Thursday, February
20,2020 from 9:303m to 1:30pm at the World Bank Offices in Washington DC (located at 1818 H St
NW) on floor C2, conference room MC (32-125.

As you know, the novel Coronavirus outbreak, which started in Wuhan, China, is evolving rapidly As of
today, the number of confirmed cases has increased significantly to over 60,000 and the virus has
reached 25 countries. The outbreak, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), poses
a threat to countries worldwide, especially those with weak health systems and low levels of pandemic
preparedness.

It is of urgent importance that we move quickly to finance the development of the appropriate
countermeasures fora disease that risks becoming endemic across the globe. Two critical issues are
necessary to address: i) immediate financing forthe development and scale—up of a diversiﬁed portfolio
of vaccines, and ii) financing the manufacturing and procurement of vaccine for global distribution.

To enhance our discussions we are working on a background paper which we will share along with an
agenda at. the earliest. Recognizingthe short notice, we will provide remote connection details for those
unable to travel for the meeting. A working lunch will also be provided.

We hope that you will be able to participate in this important meeting. Kindly confirm your participation

to Ms. Gabrielle Williams, Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice, World Bank

and many from the senior tiers of the ﬁnance and corporate worlds up to and including former CEOs and
other executives (and even a few retired senior government folks like me). It is an active, welleread and

perspectives for interesting and well-informed discussions.

has hit two thousand world leaders in public health ofﬁcials are trying to contain it but
new infections keep showing up carl golden for example he was a passenger on the
diamond princess that‘s the cruise ship where hundreds of people got the virus we
took an aquatic clues to also alone what went wrong who knew we were going and
the crew and beautiful omar here's how he ended up in omaha carl his wife jerry
were quarantined on that Ship for twelve days in a felt fine the whole time but then
the gun on a ﬂight back to the u. s. and cart started feeling sick or wind burke from
japan to this day about two hours into the ﬂight they woke up with a high fever after
napping a little bit and the doctors on board confirmed the and then on the ﬂight
landed he tested positive for the coronavirus he's recovering now in a bio contain
mean unit at the university of nebraska's medical center he's going to have to spend
fourteen days there and isolation well you know working %hesitation ”/uheSitation
catering we‘ve heard on a but one of the two days of the different doctors each day i

didn't have a clue but got a little cough still you can you might want to debate left me
and i'rn a little to keep but maybe also because of the jet lag in the travels and
everything else on top of it no it doesn't feel any different than you know recuperating
from a regular coal carl's wave jerry hasn't been diagnosed with the virus is she‘s
being monitored in a different part of the hospital but their case is a good example of
some things we know and some things we don't know about how this Virus is
spreading so we have called doctor anthony fauci he's director of the national
institute of allergy and infectious diseases good morning sir good morning so carl
coleman was fine all those days on the ship then he gets on a plane and he gels a
fever what does that tell us about how this virus is spreading well the virus has the
ability to bind it to certain cells in your body particularly ‘in your long so you can get
anything from miles a symptomatic illness to a cough and a fever to some people
about oh about twenty percent of the people come to the attention of medical than
physicians in health care providers can get serious pneumonias requiring intensive
care it sounds like this individual is on the %hesitalion mild side of the illness
because as he said it doesn't feel much more than just a common cold and as a
matter of fact corona viruses in general prior to this all one of the causes of the
common cold okay so what does that tell us i mean bleary often looking at the cases
we're looking at a rising death toll which is tragic we look much less at the people like
carly say you know my voice is raspy a had a fever had a cough the years a wide
range of stuff symptoms with this virus did do do we know why some people seem to
be doing okay and other people are getting hit really hard well whethera couple
things about that for the first thing is that any any kind ofvirai infection or any
pathogen infection there‘s always a wide range of responses in the sense almost like
a bill shaped curve some people get no sim is at all and we do have a symptomatic
corona Virus infection with this particular episode and then there's the bulk of people
who get some sort of symptoms and then a small percentage of people do really
really very poorly now that relates to the ability of the body to handle the virus and
the one thing we know when it's not unique to this virus is that the elderly those with
underlying conditions like chronic heart disease lung disease diabetes obesity they
tend to get more complications much more than for example and otherwise healthy
individual and that's the reason why if you took at the death rate which is around two
percent for this disease at this time it is disproportionately high are among the elderly
and particularly those who have underlying conditions this is interesting question
marlin is wave terry presumably they work together the entire time they were
quarantined right and if he gets the virus she does not did she just get lucky do some
people have some sort of immune undefended don't it's a combination that's a good
question it's a combination of both there is no virus that has one hundred percent
attack rate even the most of infectious of all viruses like measles doesn't geta
hundred percent of of %hesitation vulnerable people but respiratory viruses
particularly things like inﬂuenza or the corona virus the attack rate is burying
percentage and it was if he was really likely that his wife i don‘t think she necessarily
had any on the line immune protection though that's possible the maybe some cross
reaction of immune protection with other %hesitation microbes that she came into
oontact with but in most likely is as you suggest the luck of the draw okay interesting

NIH Production to ICAN_000363

and they got to patching wondered if you could clear something up because we've
been hearing reports about so called super spread ours these you who spread the
virus to a very high a number of other people and it sounds like a scary thing out and
ijust under is this a real phenomenon there that there are people who give the virus
to more people than most and why is that happening well it is certainly the
phenomenon of the super spreading israel we story with sars hack in two thousand
two and two thousand in three and tney're episodes already With this particular new
corona virus and it's a combination of two things it’s an individual whose either at a
particular moment in time shedding a very large amount of virus which makes it
much easierto infect a group of people who are around him but you also see it
sometimes in the hospital setting when you have a number of health care providers
taking care of someone and that person is shedding a lot oi virus so the short
answer to your question is there are super spread is and it’s a real phenomenon
okay okay what we would you say at this moment is the most important or the most
pressing question about this virus that we don't have answers to yet well what we
don't know for sure we know that there are people who are infected Will without
symptoms or very minimal symptoms they hardly notice they‘re infected well we don't
know is the extent to which people who have no symptoms are spreading it so we do
know that this can occui because we have anecdotal documented cases of people
who do not have symptoms who actually have inlected someone usually a family
member but we don't know the extent to which this cars in the broad component of
this outbreak doctor anthoiiy fauci the director of the national institute oi allergy and

Your hypothesis is certainly possible, but I think unlikely. In a NEJM paper for
which I havejust written an editorial, there were 400+ patients and none younger

to and primed by coronaviruses multiple times and so if 2nd infection
enhancement were an important issue, we should have seen it in children and

Subject: Coronavirus

Good morning, Tony,

I woke up thinking this: given the relative sparing of young people during the
COV|D719 outbreak, could something similar to what happens with dengue be
going on? Could a second coronavirus infection - albeit with a genetically different
variant than the first - bring about worse disease than the first? And, since up to a
third of the common cold is caused by a variant of coronavirus, could older people
somehow have been primed by an earlier coronavirus infection?

Dear Dr Fauci:

As I mentioned on the phone, wejust todaydecided that we will have a special session on
COVID-19 at CROl. it will be on Tuesday, March 10, during the lunch break; the initial
general structure will be a 10» to 15» minute overview of the epidemic (CDC), a 25-min talk
by Ralph Barac (UNC) about the Virology of coronaVIruses, and a 10- to 15-minute
summary on what NIAID/NIH is doing and planning. We thought that this being one of the
first large medical conferences in infectious diseases this year, that it is important that we
address COVID 19 at CROl.

NIH Production to ICAN_000374 ”MW“

We know that this is terribly last minute, but the CROl Chairs and Foundation are hoping
you are free to give the NIAID/NIH update, CROI is in Boston, March 8 to 11.

Ifyou think you would be able to do this, we Wlll send a more formal communication With
details and work with Patty on the specifics Thank you so much Dr Fauci; we hope you will
be able to join us,

Dear Dr, Fauci,

It’s pretty clear that you have been ridiculously busy over the past month+ serving as our nation's
top infectious disease doctor! Thanks so much for your leadership and dedication, Dr. Fauci!

I’m actually reaching out to you on a topic other than the coronavirus, as I am uﬁting on behalf
of the co-chairs for an important NIH-American Association for Cancer Research (AACR)
conference (the NIH-AACR Cancer, Autoimmunity, and Immunology Conference) that will
be taking place on March 23-24, 2020, on the NIH campus (in the Masur Auditorium in the
NIH Clinical Center).

The co-chairs would like to invite you to be the opening speaker on Monday. March 23“. Dr.

Sharpless will be the opening speaker on Tuesday, March 24'“. Please see the attached draﬁ
agenda.

NIH Production to ICAN_000376 "mama

Now in its third year, the Cancer, Autoimmunity, and Immunology Conference focuses on: 1)
understanding the biology of immuneerelated adverse events which have occurred in cancer
patients treated with iminunotherapies and how that might inform the study of autoimmune
disease. and 2) deﬁning the potential for the study of autoimmune disease to lead to greater
understanding of the treatment and management of immune-related adverse events during and
following cancer therapies. The goal of this interdisciplinary conference is to bring together
people who might not typically interact to promote cross-fertilization for the betterment of both
research and clinical care, which is why there are four NIH ICs very much involved in the
Conference, including: NCI, NIAID, NIAMS, and NIDDK.

chairing this effort on behalf ofthe AACR is Julie R. Brahmer, MD, Johns Hopkins University.
From the NIH, we have Elad Sharon, MD, MPH, NCI; Ravi Madan, MD, NCI; Connie
Summers. PhD. NCI: Howard Young. PhD. NCI: Katarzyna Bourcier. PhD. NCI: Marie
Mancini, PhD, NlAMS; Annette Rothermel, PhD, NIAID; and Lisa Spain, PhD, NIDDK.

I know the diverse audience, including patients, researchers, clinicians, industry, regulators, and
others, would be thrilled by your presence. Of course, we also know that you have participated
in the previous two conference on this topic, which underscores why they would love to have
you participate again!

Please let us know at your earliest convenience if you are interested and able to participate in the
conference on Monday, March 23rd. If you have additional questions or concerns, you can

contact rne at 'on x'ct7laftt13ancrorg or 00(5)
Thanks again, Dr. Fauci, and l look forward to hearing from you!

NBC online asked, "What is NIAID'S position on whetherthe SARS-CoV-Z is transmissible in
asymptomatic people?”

I would propose that we send a response to Jacqueline attributed to ASF:

Early case reports indicate in certain circumstances SARS-CoV-Z is transmissible in asymptomatic
people. We do not know the extent to which asymptomatic transmission is impacting the outbreak.
However, we know that people with symptoms are usually the main driver of outbreaks of other
respiratory diseases.

Subject: Singapore Coronavirus Updates
Dear Dr. Anthony Fa uci.
I’m Bernice 00(6).

I had read your online discussion details on USA Today which says:

“ Another thing that we don't know is why, with a respiratoryvborne illness, are there virtually no
children getting infected. I mean, there are no cases of kids less than 15 years old. Does that mean for
some strange reason they're not getting infected, or the illness is so mild in children that we're not
noticing it? It‘s very clearthe median age is 56 or 59.”

I thought it would be crucial to share updates on Singa pore's coronavirus situation for your reference,
because you are the expert who could help analyze the current situation. Till date, in Singaporemmhave
two young children who are infected:

ONE YEAR OLD

“Case 76 is a oneryeareold Singaporean who was among the group evacuated from Wuhan on Feb 9.
The toddler was without symptoms when he boarded the flight back to Singapore. He was put under
quarantine upon landing in Singapore, and was confirmed to be infected with COVID—IS on Sunday
afternoon. Advertisement He is currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's
Hospital, said MOH." Quoted from httpsz/lwww channelnewsasia.com/news/singaoore/covid19»

SIX-MONTH OLD

" COUPLE, BABV AND MAID INFECTED The 287yearro|d mother , whose infection was announced on
Tuesday - works at Yong Thai Hang, a health product shop that primarily serves Chinese tourists, Her
husband, a 45-year-old Singaporean tested positive on Wednesday atabout 2pm, and is currently
warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCIDI. Both have no recent
travel history to China. The couple's child, a six-month-old boy, tested positive at the same time and is
currently warded in an isolation room at KK Women’s and Children's Hospital, The family's domestic

lam a dermatologist but also a clinical researcher and scientist.
I was reading all ofthe news regarding concerns and questions on how the fellow patients are being
infected,

A few questions arose, based on the NIH data on SARS Coronavirus, that has been much more studied,
and most likely less Virulent than the current COVID 19, which supposedly has HIV traits as well as traits
to increase transmission.

l have wondered if COVID-19 is like Legionella, and“
_ of the Diamond Princess ship.

 

I AM concerned, that based on the reinfection ofthose in Wuhan. China. afterthey returned home, on
whether 14 days ofquarantine is enough, based on the modeling and studies onthe SARS Coronavirus,
and“ may actually be needed.

with the HIV virus component of COVID 19, one must also wonder if the T cells are being infected and
passing the infection along within an infected patient. In the U.S., we may need to beware of blood
transfusions from anyone infected, even asymptomatically, With COVID 19.

I am sure that you have teams of clinicians and scientists working on this, and I don‘t know if any of the
original scientists working on the SARS models are still around at Chapel Hill to perform these related
studies and modeling

article's contribution to a ﬁeld of knowledge, and emphasizes, whenever possible, its clinical implications. The
editorial commentary should not be concerned exclusively wilh the anicle in question but rather should use the
article as a starting point for a more general discussion.

Because editorials involve interpretation and opinion, you and your potential coauthor must be free ofsigniﬁcant

This ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus, or COVlD-i9. outbreak has a number ofhistoric ﬁrsts. It's the largest
quamntinc in world history wrth China locking down over 60 million people. It‘s the ﬁrst mass repatriation of
American citizens into a quarurtinc, climbing over 1,000.

Let‘s start with some quick basics: what is coronavirus? How contagiousl7 What is the morbidity rate?
How does it compare in SARs and MFRs? More/less infectious? lethal?

Just to put this in perspective every year here in the US we deal with the ﬂu. How many Americans on average die
each year from the llu?

But as I mentioned coronavirus has resulted in a number of historic ﬁrsts, talk about what you expect could be our
scientiﬁc ﬁrsts and what roadblocks do those scientiﬁc firsts confront?

Over the years, global economic interdependence has grown in nearly every industrial sector, including health care.
But that means our health care is also globally interdependent on other systems less equipped, less transparent and
perhaps less responsible global actors.

Lhina closed the wet market where the coronavirus outbreak began on l/i , gene sequenced the virus on 1/9 so they
eoulcl develop a diagnostic test but did not share the gene sequence with the global health community until 1/12.

How transparent and quick was the Chinese response? what should the have done llwl they railed to do? What were
the consequences?

China now claims more thun 70K infected and almost 1800 deaths From the virus. But It has been widely reported
that the Chinese have lmdorreportcd both numbers. what are Countries international obligations to report accurately?
To wliom'.7 How do you know the numbers are accurate?

now does the eurrent outbreak impact the domestic medical supply chain? What steps could or should we consider
to enhance supply rhun recilienrel

What do the numbers suggest to you about what to expect regionally and worldwide? Have numbers peaked? Will
they continue to rise? With the cruise ship there re now a total of 15 Americans infected. Do you expect additional
cases? What scale? How prepared are we nationally? Locally?

Looking back over the roughly past decade. emerging infectious diseases played a recurring ominous theme. Be it
from HlNI, to ebola, then Zlka, and now the 2019 novel coronavirus, the threat is clearly not dissipating. When it
comes to non-disease natural disasters, the Staﬂ'ord Act provides a Disaster Keliefl‘tind to enable immediate
response. By comparison, there is 2i small Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund. Do we need a more
Staﬁ‘ord Act-like mechanism to enable quicker response and research to these new threats? What other ac1ions can
we take to bettei prepare?

While otten we see folks painting emerging infectious diseascs and biodefcnse into scparatc categories. the truth is
that there is- signiﬁcant crossover in terms of preparedness and research. Understanding that this is n sensitive topic.
could you talk about how we . ould approach these risks in a comprehensive manner thnt eon achieve public health
and national security objectives concurrently?

I’d like to use this to transition to the topic of bio weapons which is what we originally planned to talk about. The

landscape here has also Iransliirmeri When RinShield was written rind the Strategic National Sinckpile estahlished
we worried abOLi State actors deployzng banned weapons like small pox; plague and hemorrhagic fever. And you

NIH Production to ICAN_000416

still must prepare against those things as well as new and emerging threats like the toxins we have seen deployed by
Russia and North Koren in more targeted assassinations.

How do you stay ahead of these threat "1 Do we have the resources and surveillance that we need to stay ahead ofthe
threat? And ensure the necessary vaccines and therapeutics?

The, Ebola outbreak may he. an instructive example, it seams m be coming under some contml despite the precilrinus
security situation in the Democratic Repnhlic ofCrtngo. But the ongnzng 2m x outbreak was the second largest in
history following the 2013-2016 West African outbreak. As a result ofthesc outbreaks, the United States
government has pioneered new FDA-approved diagnostics and vaccines. with promising therapeutics seemingly
around the approval comer too. What lessons can we draw from the cbola outbreaks? How do you work with and
inecntivize industry to develop what you need in the event ofa catastrophic bio attack? And How do you make the
best possible decisions about the stockpile?

I always worried that because we are global leaders if there was a bio attack or outbreak anywhere in the world,
others would look to us and to our stockpile for the answer. Are our global allies doing enough to prepare against
these threats—whether they be manmade or natural? Are they maintaining adequate stockpiles of medical
countermeasures and research bases--and should they be?

Lastly (if we have tilrlc).. .the FBI recently arrested a Harvard scientist for accepting undisclosed grant money from
China for scientiﬁc research It has now been reported that there are similar investigations at a number of US
universities including Yaie and MIT to name two and that the grant monies are in the billions. What are foreign
guvenllnclils looking l'ol? why in the US? Clearly ariaziunal seturily rislt. is it n bio weapons concern?

therapeutic antiviral activities of IFN-ns/bc(clinically approved formulations) against COVID- 19 which
poses a potential throat to global health. Further information is detailed in the attached. The ICIS would
be happy to provide the scientiﬁc and clinical expertise for this program and welcome further discussion.
In particular Dr. Eleanor Fish copied above has the track record and expertise in this area.

Sincerely.

Dear Dr. Faucr,

It is With trepidation that I reach out to you with information that has been shared vtith me regarding the real status
of the Coronavirus in Chlna My information comes to me from a (b) (6) who has correspondence from
a nurse in Harbinc China.

00(5) is here on an H] V Visa. employed for the past several years at (b) (5) in
the international student program. 00(6)
I have no reason to doubt the authenticity oftlie correspondence that she shared with me.

This correspondence shows .1 lung eray, a glass container ofbloody tluid removed from an infected lung, and a
map oft-larlsrn, China depicting runny areas ofthe coronavirus outbreaks. The written correspondence reveals that
die numbers being released of conﬁrmed deaths is drastically low due to the spread being too fast to test. Deaths in
hospital hallways and ofmedieal staffis not being shared in order to prevent panic

Protective gear is unavailable and the nurse writing the correspondence is fearful for her life. She states that there
are ﬁve levels ofscreenings (tests") before a person is reported as testing positive or ofbeing infected with the VimS.
If someone dies before being conflnneds these suspected deaths are covered up and not reported. Reported numbers.
even of confirmed cases are grossly undercourtted.

I figure you and our government reallze the information and numbers coming out ofChina are highly inaccurate, but
this correspondence on 00(6) ccntirms ii. i felt it was only ethical and moral to report this, despite

00(6) plea that the two people involved in the correspondence fear governmental retribution if it was
discovered that they discussed or passed on this conﬁdential information.

1 report this and svtear it to be true arid conﬁdential 1 am trusting it will help in some way arid not just stir panic.

NIH Production to ICAN_000424 "mums

So I'm hoping that your department has contacted the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and see if
you could make the following idea national or international. It is a supplemental health system based
on Aland mobile technology and consists oftwo planks:

First:

- train an Alto be able to detect COVID-lQ by measurements that can be done by cell phone (for
example pictures of patients, recordings of patient's respiratory system)

Second:
- develop and release a smart-phone application that does the following:

- turns on location tracking so health authorities can see where the cell phone owner is.

- allows for people to upload health measurements from their cell phone.

- keeps TRACK of where the cell phone owner is. lfthat person then tests positive for covm later
on, it can then automatically figure out all the contacts ofthat person forthe last 14 days.

- notifies those contacts that they have been in Lonlact with someone with COViD-19, to isolate
themselves and regularly test themselves.

The goal would be to prevent hundreds of thousands of peoplefrom descending on hospitals and
overwhelming them, and to allow for the CDC or other medical personnel to go OUT and get them ~
or isolate them for treatment in their own homese rather than having them come in and infect
everybody.

Now this all hinges on the idea that Al could detect COVIDel9 based on an audio recording or a simple
picture and do It reliably, but I'm fairly sure that it can based ofthe peer~reviewed literature. It Is not
a difficult Al problem assuming that the microphone can pick up sounds well enough ~ it not, there are
already integrated Stethoscopes for cell phones that could be mass produced - and once developed
to enough precision it could be deployed nationally or internationally fairly easily.

For all I know something like this is already in the works but i haven't heard ofanything like it A apart
from the Chinese app which /\F/\|CT does not use any /\I but DOES allow for automatic contact
tracing.

I sincerely hope this is already in the works. Ultimately it could be used both for detection and
treatment — assuming the current antivirals work out they could be distributed to the same
coordinates that positive diagnoses come in, perhaps by cheap drone so that nobody actually needs
to be exposed to the virus to effect treatment.

Anyways, thanks for yourtime and efforts. Personally I'm a software developer but I'm hoping that
perspective his helpful , for i view the fight against this virus as an INFORMATIONAL fight. It's like a
fire-suppression system or food safety measures. Again, I have no clue whether or not this is already
being done, and I apologize in advance if I'm missing something and this all seems obvious,

liust think that in this case it is prudent for us to be safe ratherthan sorry.

Dr. Fauci,

Might you be available to update ourviewers on the latest developments in the coronaVlrus story
today/tonight? We are particularly interested in getting your evaluation of the passengers who have
been released from two cruise ships. The first, in Yokohama, Japan, where over 300 Americans released
from the ship have now arrived back in the US, to go into 14 days of quarantine. 14 ofthose people
tested positive at some point after leaving the ship, but before they boarded the plane. The second ship
we want to focus on is in Cambodia. Something in the neighborhood or 1,000 passengers released from
that ship have been reported to be in some state of travel to their homes, presumably around the globe.
One woman who made it as far as Malaysia tested positive there and is hospitalized in Kuala Lumpur.
We do know that the CDC is working with WHO and the cruise ship line to track down those traveling
people.

We would very much like to hear from you what level of concern we should have over those many
hundreds of people traveling right now, how well quarantine works, how important it is to maintain it,
etc, We would also like to much on the methods of containment and treatment being done inside China
and how well those methods have worked.

I realize it is a holiday, and that could complicate things. But please let me know whether you Could
consider this, Doctor, and we will begin to work our the logistics.

Thank you.

Very best regards,
Dave

Hi Dr Fauci,

I hope this note finds you well and that you’ve gotten a little rest over the weekend, during what I’m
sure is an inordinately busy time. Would you be able to elaborate on the measures taken to keep the 14
US evacuees who have coronavirus from infecting others on board the plane? I know that remdesivir,
under compassionate use, was given to at least the first American coronavirus patient, and last week
NlH researchers published results early that it had preventive effects for macaques exposed to MERS.
Has the US considered using this drug to protect those exposed to but not yet infected with
coronavirus?

Thank you,

I have no idea what this guy is talking about. 1 have never said the R0 was close to 5 oi 6. The R0 is about 2,0
to 2.2. Also. the situation is as we have discussed on several occasions, In the USA, the travel restrictions scout to
be working with only 15 cases in the USA ll3 travel and 2 spouses). But, as I have said, this could change Ifwe
get substantial sustained transmission in a number ofcountries throughout the world. including the developing
world, then sooner or later there will be sig1iﬁcant leakage ofinfected individuals into the USA since you cannot
restrict incoming rravel from the whole world. The way we might he able in avoid a real global pandemic is ifthe
non-China countries can contain the infections in their respective countries before there is widely distributed
sustained transmissions, Onee widely distributed sustained transmissions happen, a global pandemic is inevitable.
What would zt global pandemic mean? It cepends on the true rates of morbidity and mortality. The currently
reported mortality ofCOVIDe19 is about 2%. However, them are several folds more cases than are coming to the
ofﬁcial attention ol'health authorities i.c. asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections. Ifyou count these,
the denominator gets much larger and thc cast: fatality latc could drop to 1% ofcveli 0 5 ‘Vo or less. Iftliat is the
case, then this could he a very severe sca501alllu(0.2% to 0.4%, regular seasonal ﬂu is 0.1%) or a typical pandemic
like 1957 or 1968 (0.5% 41.9 %). We arc not sure where it is gonig to land.

Hope this is helpful.

Read this! This is unsettling if true efﬁcient spreading in asymptomatics with negative test. Is that

A few things I want to highlight»

 

1. Means of spread A study from AMA confirmed many of the parameters assumed in our
models:

, A 20year old infected with COVlD-19 left Wuhan and went on infecting 5 relatives. When
they tested positive, she was finally isolated, but tested negative still, and later tested
positive, and remain normal on chest CT with no fever, stomach or respiratory symptoms
(cough or sore throat as late as Fen 11 (time of the papert study duration).

So spreading and its wide scope is unavoidable because there exists these very healthy
individuals who can spread effectively »- even during incubation period -- while they
remain perfectly healthy. It also showcases difﬁculty in testing -- negative test -- may not
be the end of it.

2. Iranian cases, though mysterious since the origin was not traced to China, may very well
show that COVID-19 virus is very adaptable and mutating rapidly.

3. Long recovery The long recovery period is troubesome and must be taken seriously by
health providers as they prepare for hospitalization. Therei s not much surge capacity in
hospitals. 50 they must be innoative in the staggering process and isolation is of
paramount importance. Government/Local should be readied for supplementing medical
tents outside hospitalswhen needed (clearly extra staff tool.

4. Citizes' View I was traveling so i did a real-time on-the-road analysis of human behavior
and anxiety level. I overheard many people

—- (a) asked when CDC would tell us more on what to do.

-- (b) wish they could pull their kids out of school but there is no such option as part of the
preventive measure (not announced by CDC).

—- (c) wish CDC would recommend tele-work options so they don't have to travel and
expose themselves and their family to unneccessary risk.

—- (d) have no clue what the government is doing to keep the risk low as it is now. What
exactly is being implemented to keep it low.

5. Resource-limited countries | praythat it would not reach the resourceriimited countries
like many in Africa (though it seems unavoidable). I cannot imagine the consequence.

6. what we must do: We must leverage the knowledge from othercountries to better
prepare ourselves. Japan's Crusis shows the importance of TIMELV proper isolation and
STRATEGiC operations logistics in testing and in quarantine. South Korea (contrasting with
Hong Kong, Singapore) demonstrates critical importance of EARLV social distancing and
high compliance community NPI intervention. China's latest lockdown of 1/2 billion people
truly signifies that gravity and unchartered terrority of this virus. No country would take to
such extreme measure.

7. CFRSince over 90% of influenza is never recorded/known, this COVlD-19 seems to fall
into similar spirit now, with so many cases of asymptomtic and transmission while
incubating. While the true CFR remains unknown, the CFR of tested positive cases should
offer a good comparison to the CFR of tested positive flu cases. That gives us a clearer
estimate of healtheresource burden,

greatest concern is what this would mean for critical infrastructure
sectors (including components of our healthcare system), The strategies
I outlined for outpatient clinics could be used by business (most
especially CI sectors) to maintain business continuity. It is as simple as
the old saying, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket ” It is both
contingency planning (continuity of operations/continuity of business)
and application ot'NPIs/T LC (especially social distancing in the
community supported by home isolation and home quarantine).

We now have COVID in several countries across the ME (Iran, Israel,
Egypt, Lebanon, UAE). We added Iran the day before yesterday and 3
countries yesterday (Israel, Egypt and Lebanon). Iran already appears
lo have a well established outbreak lhal will be tough lo slow down

was by Jan-20). Japan 18 also seeing acceleration with local

Italy is another area to watch.

ﬂ Numerous infected in the hospital of Schiavonia (Padua)

”And unfortunately, what the experts feared since yesterday has occurred,
when it was discovered that two patients had been hospitalized for about ten
days at the Schiavonia hospital (Padua) wrthout knowing that they had
contracted the Coronavirus: since yesterday evening everyone those who
attended the hospital were subjected to a swab to detect any infections, and
the examination gave positive results in numerous cases. lt means thatthere
are other people, probably among those who attended the ward where two
patients were hospitalized, who are now positive for the virus and
consequently could in turn have spread the infection. Already yesterday
evening the Governor of Veneto Luca Zaia ordered the progressive
evacuation of the Padua hospital which should take place within 5—6 days."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics said on Saturday that one
coronavirus case had been conﬁrmed at its mobile device factory
complex in the southeastern city of Gumi, causing a shutdown of its
entire facility there until Monday morning.

Samsung Electronics, the world's top smartphone maker. said the ﬂoor
where the infected employee worked would be shut down until the
morning of Feb. 25.

“The company has placed colleagues who came in contact with the
infected employee in self-quarantine and taken steps to have them tested
for possible infection," Samsung said in a news release

Samsung’s factory in Gumi accounts for a small portion ofits total
smartphone production, and it makes high-end phones, mostly for the

domestic market. Samsung produces most of its smartphones in
Vietnam and India.

Gumi is close to the city of Daegu, home to a church at the center of
South Korea’s largest coronavirus outbreak.

South Korea said on Saturday that the number of people infected with
the coronavirus in the country had more than doubled to 4334

Samsung said production at its chip and display factories in other parts
of South Korea would not be affected.

Wuhan to add 19 additional hospital (when combined with the other 3
hospitals, this would add 30,000 beds),

Just to put that in perspective.

- There are 2.8 hospital beds in the US per 1,000 population.
0 30,000 beds is about the number of beds we would have for a
population of 11 M.

When you add the 30,000 beds plus the 13,348 other beds added (total
0f43,300 beds)

0 There are 4.5 hospital beds in China per 1,000 population

0 43,300 beds is about the number of beds in China for a population of
9.6 M

- Wuhan will have nearly doubled its bed capacity

How hard would that be for us to double bed capacity in any major US
city? (Really isolation beds for mild illness)

On a totally different note. Others have been plying With and
modifying the notional 00110175 for a healthcare system.

1 set up some simple rules:

1. Protect uninfected patients and staff from infectious patients and
staff (using all the tools that we have including home isolation and
home quarantine, cohorting/physical separation, PPE, telehealth,
etc.)

2. Provide acute care for COVID patients (continuum of [Ft—inpatient
care—intensive care)

3. Support mildly III COVID patients In home |so|atlon~-telehealth

4. Support patients in voluntary home quarantine—~telehealth

NIH Production to ICAN_000467 ””1475

5, Continue to address the usual mix of healthcare needs for patients
(from outpatient care to acute care to mental health ca re to long
term care)

a, Outpatient clinics and providers focus on wellness to
minimize ER visits/hospitalization to unburden the acute
care system—leverage telehealth

b. Continue to provide acute care and inpatient mental health
care (continuum of ERrinpatient carerintensive care) for none
COVID conditions

5. Protect high-risk patients in residential/long term care
(nursing homes, hospice, long term psychiatry, etc.)

The notional conops divides the healthcare system into hot and safe
areas. The hot area is only acute care: ER-acute inpatient care-ICU
care. The safe areas include a separate acute care area (EReacute
inpatient carevICU care), all the outpatient clinics/care, other inpatient
care areas such as mental health, as well as long term/residential care
(nursing home. hospice. long term psychiatry, etc).

Triage will not be easy (between hot and safe). Best I could come up
with would be: (1) anyone already on home isolation or home
quarantine (may need amedical record ﬂag); (2) anyone with ILI (could
narrow that down with a negative rapid ﬂu test); (3) anyone with a sick
household member with suspected COVIDi Could be very difﬁcult for
an unconscious/confused, or trauma patient etc., but would probably err
on the side of hot and think of additional layered strategies to minimize
patient risk within that area (private rooms, patient PPE'.’). Triage
would need to err on the Side ofkeeping the safe area safe.

The mitigation measures are our best tools to reduce community
transmission and reduce the probability of an infectious patient getting
into a safe area. If we have a breach in a safe inpatient area, it pretty
much converts that inpatient area into a hot area. That also means that
we have the staff in that area exposed (because oflimited availability of
PPE, the staff in the safe area would not be PPEiPPE would have been
directed to the staff in the hot area). Those staff would likely need to be
placed on quarantine. The effect is we now have a much larger hot area
with even fewer staff that would really be a mess.

NIH Production to ICAN_000468

You have the same problem in the outpatient areas, Have a sick patient
slip through and come in contact with a number of the clinic staff (not
in PPE), and we now need to quarantine all those staff. In contrast to a
breach for the inpatient area. the outpatient area can still operate as a
safe area (just minus those staffwho would now be on quarantine). But
do that a few times and pretty soon you have nobody leﬁ to fight. One
way I thought about dealing with this scenario is to take the outpatient
staff and split them in two. One group works the clinic (physically
present) for the usual clinic hours for a 14 day stretch (1 incubation
period). Another group works from home (and practices social
distancing, etc., really acting as if they are on home quarantine) and
leverages telehealth technology to care for patients and help with
monitoring those patients in home isolation and home quarantine, After
14 days the groups switch. [All along we monitor employees daily
(whether at work or at home) for symptoms or sick household
members] In the event ot'a breach, the groups immediately switch and
the group that was working is placed on actual home quarantine (but
still continues to work from home leveraging telehealth). That way if a
breach does happen, we have a fallback response (that we are constantly
practicing) that allows us to sustain outpatient care.

For the inpatient areas, [ thought about the lone survivor model (holding
back 1 Secretary and staff in the event that the government is
decapitated), So think of a small group (would need to think thru what
the composition of that team would look like for each area (acute care,
inpatient mental health, long term care) that would at least provide the
nucleus of the expertise necessary to reconstitute the service in the
event of a major breach), This smaller group would vary in team
members every 2 weeks and would rotate to work from home for 14
days stretches and practice social distancing (acting as if they were on
home quarantine). They could also assist via telehealth (inpatient
consultation, etc, while out ofthe hospital)

Is anyone thinking along these lines (really continuity of operations for
the healthcare system)?

China has again modiﬁed its reporting (ﬁrst it added clinical cases to
lab conﬁrmed cases on Feb-12). Now it is subtracting out those clinical
cases and limiting numbers to lab conﬁrmed) Have continued to
follow the hospitalization data from Hubei (see below).

Here is the data being reported by Hubei and Wuhan. Data is pretty

S. Korea reports 52 new virus
cases, total now at 156

Welfare/Medicine 10:37 February 21, 2020

SEOUL, Feb. 2] (Yonhap) -- South Korea reported 52 new cases ofthe
new coronavirus Friday, bringing the total number of infections in the
nation to 156, with the potentially fatal illness spreading fast across the
country.

The number of COVID- l9 infections here has almost tripled in just
three days, with most new infections traced to church services in the
southeastern city of Daegu.

0fthe 52 new cases, 41 are in Daegu, 300 kilometers southeast of
Seoul, and the neighboring North Gyeongsang Province, Another three
were reported in Seoul. the Korea Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement.

Tour buses are parked at a logistics terminal in Daegu, 300 kilometers
southeast of Seoul, on Feb 20, 2020‘ Thirty-eight new coronavirus
cases were reported in the city on Feb 21, 2010, (Yonhap)

The KCDC said two new cases were reported in South Gyeongsang

Provrnce. In a sign that the virus may broadly spread nationwide, six
provinces, including Gyeonggi, Jeju, Chungcheong andNonh Jolla,

each reported one case.

NIH Production to ICAN_000476 ”HOW“

Of the 52 new cases, 39 are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in
Daegu, where the 3 lst patient, the country's probable “super spreader,"
attended worship services, the KCDC said.

A 61-year-old South Korean woman, who tested positive for the Virus
earlier this week, attended worship services at the church on Feb. 9 and
this past Sunday.

KCDC Director Jung Eun~kyeong told reporters Thursday that the
agency is uncertain whether the woman, known as the 31 st patient. was
a "super spreader" of the Virus but asked 1,001 members of the church
to self~isolate to stem the spread of the virus.

The government decided to designate Daegu and neighboring Chenngdo
as "special management zones," following the spike in the number of
infected people and the nation's ﬁrst death from the virus,

This is new

. Now 634 cases confirmed on the cruise ship (3,063 tested) (so not all
the ship and crew have been tested 3.711)

- Slightly more than half are asymptomatic (previously we heard that
73 of 355 are asymptomatic)

- 28 in serious condition (4.4%)

Japan’s Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told Parliament the two people
from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who died had “received the best
medical treatment" but couldn’t be saved after catching the novel
coronavirus on board. As of Thursday, 634 passengers and crew
members were diagnosed with the virus out of3.063 tested, Slightly
more than halt‘have no symptoms at all, officials said, and many of the
remainder have only mild fever or a cough. Among patients who tested
positive for the virus 28 were reported in serious condition Thursday.

Doctors have said the virus can be particularly harmful in elderly
patients, and one ofthe two fatal cases from the Diamond Princess, a
Japanese man in his 805, had pro-existing bronchial asthma and had
been treated for angina. The other, a Japanese woman in her 80s without
underlying illnesses. came down with a fever on Feb, 5, the same day
passengers were told they would be quarantined in their cabins for two
weeks. according to health ministry ofﬁcials. The next day, she started
suffering from diarrhea and saw a doctor on board.

She wasn’t taken to a hospital until Feb. 12 when she started suffering
shortness ofbreath. Her virus test came back positive the following day,
and despite treatment with antiviral drugs normally used to treat HIV
infection, she died Thursday.

Asked about the woman’s case, health ministry ofﬁcial Hiroshi Umeda
said. “l believe itwas handled promptly." He said the ship was a
difﬁcult environment for medical staff but they worked day and night
and tried to prioritize the most serious cases.

Korea (see story below)

South Korea now reporting 104 cases and 1 death today, South Korea
now implementing NPIs. This story is eerily reminiscent of the actions
taken at Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis in l918.

Also attached are update for Singapore (85 cases; 46 in hospital/4 in
ICU; 4 kids, only 1 in hospital) and Hong Kong (69 cases, still no kids
reported). Both have implemented NPIs (small increases in cases
today). Japan has reponed 10 new cases todayitolal now is 94,

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea reported its ﬁrst coronavirusviinked
death Thursday, while the US. military tightened restrictions on travel to the
southeastern city of Daegu due to an outbreak in infections in the area.

Daegu also urged residents to stay home as the city of 2.5 million
people and surrounding areas struggled to contain an outbreak of the
pneumonia-like disease.

The Army garrison in Daegu also restricted access and announced that
schools and nonessential business would be closed for a second day on
Friday.

NIH Production to ICAN_000481 ”mom‘s"

In an exception to policy, US. service members were authorized to
wear face masks in uniform ”regardless of air quality conditions,”
according to the garrison’s Facebook page.

Fast-moving developments this week were a blow to South Korea‘s
hope that the crisis was easing.

Instead, dozens ofnew cases were conﬁrmed in recent days, with the
total number of infections soaring to 104 on Thursday, according to the
Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

us. l-orces Korea said, “there remains zero conﬁrmed cases of U StK
personnel with COVlD-l9."

The virus ﬁrst appeared in December in Wuhan, China, and spread to
nearly 30 countries. More than 2,000 people have died most in
mainland China.

 

A South Korean man in his 60s died Wednesday at a hospital in the
southeastern city of Cheongdo and posthumously tested positive for the
Virus, the KCDC said Thursday. It was South Korea’s ﬁrst death from
the virus,

USFK raised the risk level for the military communig to moderate

on Wednesday and banned all nonessential travel to Daegu due to an
outbreak linked to a church near the Amiy garrison in the city.

On Thursday, USFK added that all travel by American troops to, from
and around Daegu requires authorization from their leadership. The
precaution was “highly encouraged" for all family members. civilians
and contractors as well.

“All off-installation travel for all USFK populations should be
minimized to reduce potential contamination," USFK announced on its
website.

us Army Garrison Daegu, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul, also
said visitors not performing mission essential or ofﬁcial business would
be denied access as it implemented health checks at the gates.

Nonessential personnel were not required to go to work on Friday and
most activities would be suspended, including the schools, it said.

The garrison also recommended that members of the military
community avoid public places and transportation in the city, including

stores, restaurants and other heavily congested areas until the situation
is brought under control.

Self—quarantine measures were ordered for any American troops who
had visited the affected New World Church, but garrison commander
Col, Edward Ballanco said earlier Thursday that no Americans were
known to have done so

He also urged Americans to avord a local hospital where the woman
believed to have been a carrier was treated.

The garrison also lifted limits on wearing face masks for American
troops in uniform, who normally are only allowed to wear them on days
with extreme pollution.

Last thing. Keep a very close eye on Japan. The outbreak is starting to
take off there with numbers of cases scattered across the country with
no link to known cases. We are also seeing nosocomial transmission (a
number of healthcare workers infected). There is also a large number of
cases hospitalized in Japan related to the cruise ship, and now the
release oflarge numbers ofpassengers from the cruise ship into the
community, Yesterday they reported a total of 84 cases%aught up to

Singapore. But unlike Singapore, Japan has been slow to implement
NPIs. The other concern is that Japan's population is
disproportionately aged (it has the highest % age 65 ofany country). In
Japan, 27% ofthe population is 3 65; in the US, 15.6% 0fthe
population is 3 65. And Japan can also claim the largest city in the
world (metro Tokyo with 38 M people—pretty much the population of
California crammed into an area smaller than the size of Connecticut)

Japan also has the 10Lh largest city in the world (Osaka with 19 M

What has me worried is what happened on the cruise ship is a preview
ofwhat will happen when this virus makes its way to the US healthcare
system (not to mention institutionalized high»risk populations in the
US, like nursing homes). I’m not sure that folks understand what is just
over the horizon.

Remember the story about Mann Gulch? We are at the equivalent of
about 5:44. I anticipate that when we reach 5:45, there is going to be
chaos and panic to get anything in place. I doubt that what we would

NIH Production to ICAN_000484 N'H‘M’WZ

then hurriedly put in place will be any better than what they did on that
cruise ship. As a consequence, would expect much the same results.

I listened to the diseussmn yesterday. After listening to James and
Michael describe the conditions on and around the cruise ship, I
wondered whether anyone in healthcare leadership (outside the
expertise at our biocontainment facilities) is thinking about infection
control practices for any staff entering areas of a hospital caring for
COVID patients (like changing clothes before entering and perhaps
wearing scrubs, not bringing personal items into the area like iphones,
ipads, Stethoscopes, white coats, purses, briefcases, etc)? And
instituting policies that require all patients to phone for clearance to
enter prior to presenting at safe acute and nonracute areas including
community based clinics? Are we confident of the infection control
practices of acute care staff (that they know the basics of how to don
and doff PPE and behavior while in PPE'.’) Would HCWs in outpatient
clinics or long term care facilities be any better prepared than the crew
on board the cruise ship or the responders in Japan? I’m no expert in
infection control and would defer to the expertise in this group. I was
just a little surprised how little this seemed to be a concern for the
healthcare leaders gathered yesterday.

I think we are getting close to the point where we need to drop those
things that are not critical and focus on the most important things.

We are going to have a devil oftime with lab confirmation—it is just
too slow (they had a 2 day turnaround on the cruise ship) and we just
don't have the capacity for the volume of tests we would anticipate,
Charity has stressed this point again and again, 'l'hat means we are
going to have to ﬂy blind early on. Perhaps the best we are going to be
able to do in the near term ifthings begin to accelerate is screen all
suspect cases (pretty much anyone with ILI symptoms) with a quick ﬂu
test and assume anyone who tests negative is suspected COVID until
proven otherwise; and treat everyone who tests positive with Tamiﬂu.
It will prove problematic early on, but as the epidemic barrels along,
COVID will displace everything (at that point we will just assume that
anyone with a fever or lLI has COVID). The problem is in the
beginning. It is going to be so hard to sort things out. Matt, James and
others are pushing for more rapid screening—but we Just aren’t there
yet. The consequence is that we will be placing patients with rcsp
illness (that is not ﬂu and presumed to be COVID) in areas with actual

NIH Production to ICAN_000485

COVID patients, I hate to do that. but not sure how it could be avoided
early on. But we would only do that for those who are ill enough to be
hospitalized. The large number of asymptomatic and mildly ill patients
would be under home isolation (so no worries about mixing conﬁrmed
and suspected patients). The downside is that we would have larger
number of people is isolation and home quarantine than is really
necessary (and the consequence of increased workplace absenteeism).

And it is because home isolation and home quarantine are so important,
hoalthcarc systems (and not just public health) have to grab a hold of
operationalizing those NPIs with both hands. A while back, I created
some prescriptions (tongue in cheek). just to underscore that physicians
do have a role in isolation and quarantine (it is not limited to public
health). We might not have pharmaceuticals available to treat COVID,
but why can’t we write prescriptions for non-pharmaceuticals? I don't
think healthcare leaders appreciate this point. Every COVID patient we
admit or see in the ER will require us to follow up with household
members to make sure they know to home quarantine (need to do the
same anywhere in our system we find a patient who is infected). You
could not imagine the pushback I have received when I proposed that
we must have an active role~people seem to think that state and local
public health is alone responsible for this. I would think public health
will be overwhelmed and taking charge of this is our best strategy to
keep our safe areas safe.

I would be interested to hear how other healthcare systems and public
health leaders are thinking about this.

Keeping track of the outbreak aboard the cruise ship. The latest update
is the announcement of 2 deaths (both patients in their 805). An 87-
year-old man and an 84-year—old woman, died on the 20th. Both were
Japanese (the 87-year—old man was hospitalized on Feb-11 and the S4-
year»old women on Feb- 12). So time to death from recognition of
infection was 8-9 days. On Feb—12. the total number of confirmed cases
was 203. So estimated CFR back dating the denominator to Feb-12 is
1%. Assuming a denominator of 621, the CFR is 0.3%. ifdeaths are
lagging by 8—10 days (and confirmed cases plateau), we should have a
pretty good estimate of CPR for he entire group in another week or so,
Will need to peel off the number ot‘cases involving the crew member to
get a better estimate of CFR in the elderly. These numbels are withIn
the range we have been estimating.

The 2,666 passengers are similar in age (and likely in co-morbiditics) to
the population we see in a nursing home or residential care facility. The
1,045 crew are a proxy for a young healthy population. It will be
important to look at the outcomes separately. One of the concerns is
how a ‘remake of this movie’ could play out in similarly conﬁned
populations ofelderly frail Americans. Here are the numbers of long
term care facilities/programs in the US that care for the frail elderly. A
large number of locations and a large number of residents/participants. I
know that healthcare leaders were engaged yesterday, is anyone
engaging this sector (long term care)? The healthcare leaders seemed
more concerned about critical supply shortages (akin to the 1V ﬂuid
shortage). Listening to them. it felt like their concerns seemed almost
divorced from the threat of COVID.

New virus cruise ship disembarks and kills two Japanese
passengers in hospital

February 20, 2020 11'38

Two Japanese men and women in their 80s who were hospitalized and
treated for the virus were killed on the 20th in a cruise ship passenger who
was confirmed to be infected with the new coronavirus. This is the first time
a cruise ship passenger has died and three people have been killed in the
country

As ofthe 19th, 621 cruise ships out of approximately 3,700 crew members
and passengers on the cruise ship where outbreaks of the new coronavirus
were confirmed were confirmed.

According to government officials, two of them, a 87—year-old man and an 84-
year-old woman. died on the 20th.

Both wereJapanese and had a basic illness and were confirmed to have been
infected with the virus, so it wassaid that men were hospitalized on the 11th
of this month and women on the 12th to be treated.

This is the first time a cruise ship passenger has died.

In addition, three people have been killed In Japan, followmg the death of a
woman in her 805 living in Kanagawa Prefecture on the 13th of this month.

Australian cruise passengers arrive
to Darwin after Diamond Princess
virus outbreak ordeal

Feb 20

A rescue mission of Australian cruise ship passengers from Japan has
officially landed in Darwin, but the ﬂight wasn‘t free from drama.

Thousands ofpeople sharing toilets, pools and buffets — is this the petri
dish of the sea?

The Qantas coronavirus rescue ﬂight, carrying about 180 citizens and
permanent residents on board from Japan, has landed in Australia.

Qantas ﬂight 6032 touched down in Darwin at 8.1 lam local time, after
being slightly delayed from takeoff our of Haneda.

The last-minute drama hit the rescue mission when 10 Australians, who
were set to leave the coronavirus—hit Diamond Princess ship and head to
the airport, were told they had tested positive to coronavirus and had to

stay behind.

About 1X0 citizens and permanent residents, who have spent the past
fortnight on the quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan, had m
up the Federal Govemment‘s offer of a seat on the repatriation ﬂight to
Australia.

 

l'hey join another 56 Australians who contracted coronavirus on the
Diamond Princess and are being treated in Japan. About 15 of their
relatives declined the offer of repatriation to stay with them.

The Australians on board will be screened for coronavirus five times
before they are taken to a quarantine facility at Howard

Qantas boss Alan Joyce praised the crew who took part in the
repatriation ﬂight as well as two previous Qantas chartered ﬂights that
brought Australians home from Virus epicentre Wuhan.

 

“It took literally thousands of hours to plan complex operations like
these,“ Mr Joyce said at tpress conference today.

“The crew were all volunteers and they did us proud.”

NIH Production to ICAN_000493

Yesterday, Australians who were cleared to ﬁnally disembark the
Diamond Princess were driven by bus to Haneda Airport for the
chartered ﬂight home.

They ﬁrst needed to pass a health check to receive an approval of
disembarkation notice by Japanese quarantine ofﬁcials.

They were then screened several more times before they could board
the Qantas 747.

On the plane, they had no contact with Qantas crew, who remained
upstairs for the ﬂight. Food for passengers was already waiting for them
at their seats when they boarded.

If they passed the latest health check, they would have been given
“approval of disembarkation" notices by Japanese quarantine ofﬁcials,
which grant them permission to enter Japan.

From Yokohama Port, where the ship was (locked, they boarded buses
to Haneda Airport.

Brisbane student Tehya Pt'et'fer, 18, who has been quarantined on the
Diamond Princess with her grandmother Cathy, was among them,

“At 10.30am (local time, 12.30pm AEDT) we wrll start to be screened
and given luggage tags and wrist bands,” Ms Pfeffer told news.com.au
yesterday.

“At 5pm we have to have our luggage put outside, and at 6pm we will
disembark the ship and go through a makeshiﬂ customs. This is where
we use our wrist bands.

“And then we will take a bus to the airport and at around 12am
Thursday we will ﬂy to Darwin."

On the evacuation flight, cabin crew would not be making direct contact
with evacuees.

Meals were already waiting for passengers at their seats when they
boarded, and Qantas staff remained upstairs.

All those returning to Australia on the Qantas ﬂight will spend two

weeks in quarantine at the Howard Springs facility, in addition to the
two weeks in loekdown they’ve had on the ship.

Was listening to the discussion today. There was a discussion about the
shortages of PPE. There was also discussion re NPIs, but I’m not sure
that most folks apprec1ate that the NPIs that have been arrayed as part
of the TLC strategy to reduce disease transmission in the community

NIH Production to ICAN_000495 "“001593

can be leveraged to create safer compartments or spaces by shunting
disease toward the home. By implementing these interventions. one
could reduce the likelihood ofdisease in workplaces (by home isolation
and home quarantine-- keeping sick employees at home and keeping
employees who are well hutpotentially infected because someone is
sick in their household, at home). Adding in other social distancing
measures including social distancing at work, helps to reduce
community transmission (adds additional protection to the workplace).
The consequence is shunting disease to the home--120 M different
compartments in the US, and making the workplace the safe place.
That is potentially very impomnt for critical infrastructure. The
answer is not PPE for these employees. And why would we expect that
employees in these sectors would have any better IPC with the use of
PPE than we saw with staff on the Diamond Princess?

Healthcare is a key critical infrastructure. It is different from the other
sectors in that it Will be attracting patients with COVID like a magnet.
It is hard to imagine how one could makes healthcare a safe
workplace. But it is only hard to imagine how one could do that unless
you begin to look a little closer at the different components of the
healtheare system and the roles each component might play during this
pandemic.

To illustrate this. I took a stab at developing a conops or roadmap to
look at the various pieces ofthe healtheare system. The shunting of
disease is really fractal. Just as we can look at shunting disease across a
community into one compartment (the home) to make other
compartments safer, we can do the same within our healtheare systemi
shunt disease to the acute care area where COVID patients will be
concentrated. What are the strategies to do that?

This conops is notional. It is purposely designed for a severe outbreak
with severe disease and assumes that the healtheare system must
somehow continue to limp along and continue to care for the
background disease we see during normal times (strokes, AMIs,
fractures and trauma, appendicitis, other serious infections, CHF,
diabetic emergencies, psychotic episodes, preeclampsia, complicated
deliveries, end stage renal disease and dialysis, etc.) as well as sustain
outpatients with chronic conditions that require monitoring and care to
keep them well and out of the ER and out of the hospital,

Global Affairs says the departure date for a plane that will carry Canadians
home from a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship in Japan is yet to be confirmed.
Spukeswoman Barbara Harvey says the departure will be settled once final
arrangements are made with the Japanese government and the cruise ship
company. A news release from the company operating the Diamond Princess
cruise ship says the Canadian flight has been ”shifted” to early Friday
morning.

I saw a news story yesterday (WashPost) that testing was completed.
So we should know in the next coupe of days.

Also saw a story about the 100 or so Americans left behind (44 in
hospitals and 61 who declined evacuation).

Hard to ﬁnd data on the status of those still hospitalized in Japan

James made a very important point yesterday. Although the passengers
are elderly (2,666 passengers), the crew members are relatively young
(1,045 crew members). James also expected the attack rates to be very
high among the crew members (they were housed together in a
relatively small space aboard the ship, perfect conditions for explosive
disease transmission). So this combined data on passengers (elderly)
and crew (young and healthy) will be invaluable in terms of helping
understand severity. I would think that Japan also realizes how
invaluable this data is. Japan will be in the best position to assess the
impact on the crew, since they will know the results of lab screening
and hospitalization of all + crew members (as well as the monitoring
quarantine of the rest of the crew over the next 14 days) But now that
the passengers are being dispersed, it will be important for several
nations to share the data on these passengersiit is really our best
chance to understand severity (would need collaboration of the US,
Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan).

I understand from contacts at WHO that Japan is testing everyone on
the Diamond Princess, so we should have a complete accounting of that

Japan inching toward mitigation

Abe urges people with cold-

TOKYO

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday advised people
across the country not to go to work or school if they
develop cold-like symptoms. as the country grapples with
the spread ofa new coronavirus originating in China.

Workplaces in the country, known for their long hours,
need to encourage people to take days offwithout
hesitation if they do not feel well, Abe said.

“The ﬁrst thing thatl want the people otJapan to keep in
mind is to take time off school or work and refrain from
leaving the house if they dwelop cold-like symptoms such
as fever," Abe told a meeting of a government task force on
the viral outbreak,

Teleworkrng is an "effective alternative” to help prevent the
virus from spreading further, Abe said.

He made the remarks as the government is scrambling to
contain the virus that originated in Wuhan, with more
people with no obvious link to China getting infected in
Japan.

The global outbreak of the disease called COVID-19 has
prompted some event organizers in Japan to rethink their
plans for hosting mass gatherings.

The number of conﬁrmed cases in Japan has topped 600,
including over 500 passengers and crew on the Diamond
Princess, a quarantined cruise ship docked at Yokohama
near Tokyo with more than 3,000 conﬁned.

The steady rise in infections in various parts of Japan has
raised public concem, prompting the health ministry to ask
people who develop symptoms such as a temperature of
37.5 C or higher for at least four days to consult local
health care centers and go to designated hospitals. The
period is set shorter for the elderly, those with underlying
conditions and pregnant Women.

As Tokyo and other major cities in the country are
notorious for packed rush—hour trains, commuters have
been encouraged by a government panel of medical experts
to go to work earlier or later than usual as the risk of
infection is increased in crowds.

On Tuesday. Fujitsu Ltd and Hitachi Ltd said they are
expanding teleworking, though Japanese companies overall
have been slow to introduce it.

Hello all - Clearly, the most important
thing of all is a reliable, real-time
diagnostic test that can differentiate
between ﬂu and COVlD-19. CDCs test
kits were recalled because states said
they were not working. Now they have
to remanufacture the faulty reagent.
How long will that take? If and when
more kits are available, will they be
available in sufﬁcient quantity that all
health care providers will have access?

In all of this, 1 have not heard anyone
talk about the Nanopore MinlON
technology that has been used for
Ebola. What gives??? It is field
deployable and can be run in—house.
Hospital labs can run thousands of
samples at once. It gives results of all
viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, in 2
hours. We all know this technology is
quite promising. Why aren’t we going
gangbusters to validate this rapid
technology and get it to all
diagnosticians? If ever there was a time
to invest in a diagnostic technology,
this is it!

Carter,

Just listened in to our state COVlD-19 response effort
update. Georgia has no COVID719 cases yet, and hence
they remain in the containment period where they place
medium-risk individuals on supervised monitoring of home
quarantine, advise them to take temperature daily and
report any respiratory symptoms (24/7). Educate them not
to show up in ED, or any place Without facilitation. To
avoid potential disease spread, they are advised to remain at
home.

The next stage Will be mitigation when a confirmed case is
reported. That will initiate the pandemic planning and
community—based NPI will be considered. This includes
social distancing -. telework. teleelass, etc.

I assume at cities where there are conﬁrmed local COVID—
19 cases, the public health leaders have already begun the
mitigation phase now and hence are practicing some degree
of social distancing and rolling out telework, and various
strategies to protect health in the population and to
maintain business continuity already, [5 that true or they
are still waiting to execute their operations?

There are not many tests needed here in Georgia, But rapid
robust and reliable testing kits (Tracey's reporting of
current bottleneck) remain critical in all communities with
positive cases. lfwe have such means, testing can also be
conducted (sampling) on some ﬂuvlike cases at strategic
selected cities also.

Duane, Yes (asymptomatic or mild symptoms)
this is the won'y at the very start. and it
remains the most critical. Hence even 1% of

infection period, but also post-recovery. It's a
very long timeline that we have to deal with.
Then you have all the universtty siudents.
Students travelled to China and came back to
school, they asked health service ifthey
needed to quarantine or take any action,
theadviee —— no need. Those are missed
opportunities. Again, seasonal inﬂuenza
affects 8—10% Americans, 07% of those
infected required hospitalization, and morality
is roughly 0.1%. So it is easy to "calculate" all
these numbers backwards... So 20% ofCOVID-
19 infected may need hospitalization, mortality
is 10-30 times higher than seasonal ﬂu. How
much can we tolerate before anyone would
spring into action? Keep in mind, some begin
to infect rapidly upon contracting the virus. the
incubation is so short (and so long) and
infectious too during that period (with much
being unknown).

Carter, I think you will expect heterogeneous
approaches from different communities in the
overall response strategy. since it depends on
the social setting and the demographics and
more importantly the local resources. We have
to optimize for sure.

My thinking is evolving in terms
of healthcare system response.
Initially I described how I would
refocus the outpatient clinics away
from COVID care and leverage
the NPIs of isolation and
quarantine to help keep the
workplace safe (for the clinic staff
and other patients) rather than a
strategy that employs PPE. I
would only use the outpatient
clinic staff to help with
telephone/home care support of
those patients under home
isolation or home quarantine-to
help with compliance/adherence to
isolation and quarantine,
monitoring their health, and
optimizing the care oftheir other
chronic mcdical conditions (to
keep them out ofthe ER and the
hospital). But as I thought more
about this, it occurs to me that this
can be generalized beyond
outpatient clinics

I would think about dividing our
healthcare system into two big
pieces: (I) acute care (hDs, acute
inpatient care, critical care); and
(2) non-acute care including
outpatient clinics (PC/Family
Practice, pediatrics, OB/GYN,
medical specialty, surgical
specialty, dental, mental health,
rehab, etc), as well as other
inpatient areas (inpatient mental
health, substance abuse, nursing
homes, hospice care, memory
care, assistcd living, ctcr),
Inpatient surgery (andl suppose
labor and delivery) is part of acute
care, but for this outbreak, it
probably best belongs bundled
with the other non-acute inpatient

NIH Production to ICAN_000513

areas, I would anticipate that the
tripwire for implementing NPIs
(community transmission), will
also be the trigger for healthcare
systems to dial down or tum off
elective admissions (primarily
surgical) to free up acute care and
ICU/monitored medsi The most
effective way to protect these non-
acuto areas is by shunting
potential COVID patients away
from these areas and either
providing this type of care While
the patients is hospitalized in acute
care or thm telephone care/home
care for patients with mild illness
receiving care at home. And the
most effective way to shunt these
patients away from non-acute care
areas is thru the implementation of
early and aggressive NPIs of
isolation of the ill and home
quarantine of household contacts
(and not ﬁt testing the world and
passing out PPE that we don't
have).

More puzzle pieces re the cruise
ship outbreak.

. About
2/3rds of
the
passengers

NIH Production to ICAN_000515 ””1523

have been
tested so far
(2404 out
of 3.71 1).

. 61
Americans
opted to
remain
onboard and
not be
evacuated.

Japan has completed tests for all
passengers and crew aboard the
ship as of Monday, but the
results for the last batch of tests
aren‘t expected until
Wednesday, the day that the
quarantine is slated to end. So far,
results are back for 2,404
passengers and crew, out of the
3,711 who were on board the ship
when the quarantine began on Feb.
5.

Japanese Health Minister
Katsunobu Kato said Tuesday that
people who have tested negative
for the virus would start leaving
on Wednesday, but that the
process of releasing passengers
and crew won't be ﬁnished until
Friday, according to th_e
Washington Post.

The remaining 61 American
passengers on the DP who opted

estimated that 14% develop

GENEVA: The new novel
coronavirus only causes mild
disease for 250 per cent of infected
patients, said the World Health
Organization on Monday (Feb
17). Speaking to reporters, WHO
chief Tedros Adhanom
Ghebreyesus said that 14 per cent
of patients would have severe
diseases such as pneumonia,

“Around live percent of cases are
consrdered critical with possible
multi-organ failure, septic shock
and respiratory failure and, in
some cases, death," he added,

NIH Production to ICAN_000522

Tedros also said there were
"relatively few cases” among
children and more research was
needed to understand why.

The WHO chief also warned
against "blanket measures" over
the novel coronavirus outbreak,
pointing out the epidemic outside
ofChina was only affecting a
"tiny" proportion of the
population.

Ryan said that even at the
epicentre ofthe crisis in the city of
Wuhan in central Hubei Province,
the "attack rate” - a measure of the
speed of spread of the virus — was
four per 100,000,

"This is avery serious outbreak
and it has the potential to grow,
but we need to balance that in
terms of the number of people
infected. Outside Hubei this
epidemic is affecting a very, very
tiny. tiny proportion of people." he
said.

Tedros also referred to an apparent
decline in new cases of the disease
in recent days but said that the
trend ”must be interpreted very
cautiously”.

I really need help thinking thru the
testing piece (screening for
COVID—lQ), How do we protect
the staff in outpatient clinics

shifting all the mild illness away
from clinics and toward patients’
homes using telephone
care/telehealth and home
healtheare and employing home

isolation for those who are
infected and voluntary home
quarantine for otherwise well (but
exposed and potentially infected)
household contacts? Having all
the suspected patients coming in
to clinics to be screened really
defeats the purpose. So how
would very large numbers of
outpatients get screened? Home
screening? Drive thru screening?
Or creating a free standing
screening facility for rapid
screening? Has anyone thought
this thru (how you screen for
disease plus promote
adherence/compliance to home

telephone/home care to prolecl

Fourteen evacuees from the
Diamond Princess cruise

ship quarantined in Japan were
allowed to ﬂy back to the United
States Sunday despite testing
positive for coronavirus, the US,
State Department and Health and
Human Services said in a joint
statement, The evacuees were not
symptomatic,

“These individuals were moved in
the most expeditious and safe
manner to a specialized
containment area on the
evacuation aircraﬁ to isolate them
in accordance with standard
protocols,” the

statement published Sunday
read.

NIH Production to ICAN_000536 NIH-001544

The State Department was
unaware the individuals had
coronavirus when they were being
removed from the ship: they had
tested negativejust a few days
before, Robert Kadlec. the
assistant secretary for
preparedness and response at the
US. Department of Health &
Human Services, said on a phone
call with reporters.

"If those results had come back
four hours earlier before we’d
started to disembark the ship and
before these people were evacuees
within an evacuation system, then
it would’ve been a different
discusston." Dr. William Walters,
director of operational medicine at
the US. Dcpartrnent of Statc, said
on the call.

Kadlec said that individuals
received multiple screenings when
moving from ship to bus to

plane and a more extensive
medical assessment upon arrival.

Two charter ﬂights carrying

the Diamond Princess passengers
landed at military bases in
California and Texas overnight,
starting the clock on a 14-day
quarantine period to ensure those
passengers don’t have
coronavirus. In total,
approximately 380 Americans
were on board the Diamond
Princess ship for the duration of
the cruise and quarantine at sea.

One plane carrying American
passengers touched down at Travis
Air Force Base in northern
California just before 11:30 pm.
Sunday local time. A second ﬂight
arrived at Laekland Air Force
Base in Texas around 2% hours
later, early Monday.

The California ﬂight had 177
people on it, seven of whom tested
positive for coronavirus, Walters
said. An additional three people
were isolated during the ﬂight for
fever. Upon arrival, 171 stayed in
Travis while six traveled to
Omaha.

It's unclear which passengers were
transferred there and whether
initial tests were positive or
whether they were at risk for the
virus.

The Texas ﬂight had 151 people
board and included the other seven
who tested positive for
coronavirus. Two additional
passengers were isolated on
account of fever. All passengers
who tested positive for
coronavirus then moved on to
Omaha.

Ofﬁcials from the University of

“Late last night at about 2 or 3

likelihood of testing positive
because of symptoms they were

"He is doing good and in stable

Shelly Schwedhelm, Nebraska

emergency management and
biopreparedness.

She went on to note that "the folks
in the quarantine center have all
been tested, and we‘re waiting for
those results."

She added that the other 12 are

but with engineering controls“ to
prevent contaminated air from
escaping,

Their test results, which are due
back Monday afternoon, will
determine whether the patients
will be allowed to see their
spouses or leave their rooms.

Regardless of whether they test
positive or negative, all of the new
arrivals will spend at least 14 days
in the facility, and any who test
positive will likely stay longer,
said Dr. Mike Wadman, the co-
medical director of the National
Quarantine Unit,

Kratochvil says it’s possible that
they may be asked to take more
patients should more of the
Diamond Princess passengers now
in quarantine at the airbases test
positive.

Dr. Anthony Fauci. director of the
National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases at the National
Institutes ofIIealth, told the USA
TODAY editorial board and
reporters Monday that the original
idea to keep people safely
quarantined on the ship wasn't
unreasonable. But even with the
quarantine process on the ship,
virus transmission still occurred.

"The Quarantine process faile ,”
Fauci said ”I'd like to sugarcoat it

and try to be diplomatic about it,
but it failed. People were getting
infected on that ship. Something
went awry in the process of the

Trying to estimate severity by
bringing a number of pieces
together

The Diamond Princess Cruise
Ship had a crew of L745 and
2,666 passengers (total pf3,7l 1)
Approximately 400 of the
passengers are Americans (11%).
Several days ago (Feb-l3) we
attempted to estimate disease
severity using the current data
being reported by the media
(number of conﬁrmed cases and
ICU cases) as well as data on the
outbreak in Singapore (number of
conﬁrmed cases, number
hospitalized, and number in ICU)
(see attached Word file).

Given the additional information
becoming available (including
more speciﬁc information being
reported by the media on the
numbers of Americans infected), I
was interested in an updated crude
estimate of severity (and to see
how well the early predictions of
severity matched with what was
being reported by the media on
illness in the Americans. See

NIH Production to ICAN_000549 N'Hm1557

latest re the cruise ship outbreak
below (two stories). We can glean
from these stories that the number
infected is now up to 454. And [4
positive passengers were included
among the Americans who were
evacuated to the US. Canada,
South Korea, Italy and Hong Kong
announced Sunday that they
would also arrange charter ﬂights
to evacuate their citizens. A few
additional pieces of data. News
reports yesterday stated that 73 of
the 355 conﬁrmed cases from the
cruise ship were asymptomatic
(20%), Also, yesterday the media
quoted Dr, Fauci that the total
number of Americans who were
continued to have COVID
yesterday and who remained at
hospitals in Japan at 44,
Assuming that this number does
not include the 14 conﬁrmed cases
that were evacuated. suggests that
the total number of Americans
with conﬁrmed COVID is 58. An
earlier news report from Feb-l2 re
a couple from California, noted
the husband was in the [CU in
Japan (so at least 1 American in
the ICU). [“...remained in a
hospital intensive care unit and
has been able to communicate
with his family, his wife said in a
phone interview from the ship,
where she remained in
quarantine.”

with-a-high-fever-lesled—for-
coronaVirus/ ]

So. piecing all the data together:

The N400 Americans account for
11% of the 3,711 passengers and
crew ofthe Diamond Princess.

The 58 confirmed cases among
Americans account for 12% of the
454 total conﬁrmed COVID cases

Assuming that proportion of
asymptomatic cases in Americans
is similar to the proportion of
asymptomatic cases for the entire
ship (73/355 or 20%), we would
estimate the number of Americans
with asymptomatic infection at
~12. Symptomatics would be 46.
If2% ot‘cascs result in ICU
admission (based on earlier
estimates on Feb- 12 where 4 ICU
cases were reported with 203 total
continued cases). we would
expect ~9 ICU cases overall with
454 infected. Media reports from
today note 19 cfthe passengers
are “seriously ill. With some of
whom treated in intensive care
units.” (Would be helpful to
quantify “some”—froin the earlier
data, we would estimate about half
that number would require ICU
care at some point). For the 54
Americans continued to have
COVID, we would estimate 1
would require ICU care if 2% of
cases required ICU care (we are
already aware of at least 1
Amcrican who was receiving ICU
care in Japan).

NIH Production to ICAN_000551

So estimates of severity looking
only at the American passengers:

~400 total American passengers
58 conﬁrmed to haVe COVlD-19

12 Asymptomatic
(20%)

46 Symptomatic (80%)

~55% of total
cases mildly ill (hospitalized for

~25% of total
cases acutely ill requiring inpatient
care (15 cases)

~2%
oftotal cases requiring ICU
admission (1 cases)

Those estimates ﬁt pretty well
with the estimates from Feb-13.
To ﬁrm up these numbers it would
be useful to have actual numbers
from Japan on ICU admissions,
number requiring mechanical
ventilation, number in the hospital
because they are acutely ills and
number in the hospital because of
isolation only (mildly ill or
asymptomatic). Also would be
helpful to have more granular

NIH Production to ICAN_000553

infomialion on the Americans
(hospital data in Japan including
number acutely ill, number
needing ICU admission. and
number only in the hospital for
isolation). Would also be critical
to gather/compile the same
information from Canada, South
Korea. ltaly, Hong Kong, and
other nations as they also evacuate
their citizens. The cruise ship is a
circumscribed population where it
is possible to get a handle on
severity fairly eaily in an
epidemic. The limitation though,
is the population on board that
ship is elderly (so need to be
careful about generalizing to the
entire population). But it is the
best data WC have.

The reason why this is so
important is decisions re the
implementation of NPIs depend
upon severity (the more severe the
more intense the NPIS). The
SOOHCI‘ We have a more 800111316
assessment of severity, the better
for making plans for Nl’ls.

New vims cruise ship conﬁrmed
99 new infections

February 17. 2020 18:54

A new outbreak of the coronavirus
was conﬁrmed on February 17,
with 99 new passengers and crew
members infected on a cruise ship.
As a result, 454 passengers and
crew members of emise ships
have been infected, of which 19
are severely affected

According to the Ministry of
Health, Labor and Welfare, a total
of99 new passengcrs, including
85 passengers and 14
crewmembers, were revealed on
March 17 on the cruise ship
“Diamond Princess" anchored in
Yokohama Port. Among them,
there are 43 Japanese.

This means that a total of1723
passengers and crew members
were inspected on the cruise ship,
and a total of 454 infections were
conﬁrmed.

According to the Ministry of
Health, Labor and Welfare, 1‘) of
the contimied mdiViduals are
seriously ill, some ofwhom are
being treated in intensive care
units.

According to the Minislry of
Health, Labor and Welfare, the
Ministry of Health, Labor and
Welfare said that infections were
conﬁrmed one after another on

NIH Production to ICAN_000555

cruise ships. Need to be analyced
quickly. "

The Ministry of Health. Labor and
Welfare has a policy to conduct a
virus test on all passengers and
crew members remaining on
board, and those who have a
negative result Will be asked to
leave the ship after the 19th.

Story #2

Fourteen people who were
evacuated from the Diamond
Princess cruise ship and ﬂown
back to the United States on
chatter ﬂights tcstcd positivc
furnovel coronavuus, according to
a joint statement from the US
Departments of State and Health
and Human Services.

The passengers are among the
more than 300 people removed
from the ship, which is docked off
the Japanese port city of
Yokohama, Sunday night and
ﬂown to inilitaq bases in the
United States.

US ofﬁcials were notiﬁed that
they had tested positive for
coronavirus during the evacuation
process‘ after passengers had
disembarked the ship, the agencies
said in the joint statement
Monday. The passengers had been
tested two to three days before the

NIH Production to ICAN_000556

evacuation ﬂights, the statement
said.

"After consultation with HHS
ofﬁcials. including experts from
the HHS Ofﬁce ofthe Assistant
Secretary for Preparedness and
Response. the State Department
made the decision to allow the 14
indivrduals, who were in isolation,
separated from other passengers.
and continued to be asymptomatic,
to remain on the aircraft to
complete the evacuation process,”
the agencies said.

One charter ﬂight carrying
evacuated Americans arrived at
Travis Air Force Base near
Fairﬂeld, California, around 11:28
pm. local time Sunday. A second
an'ived at Joint Base San Antonio—
Lackland in San Antonio, Texas at
3:56 am. local time Monday.

The passengers who tested
positive were isolated from the
other passengers during the
ﬂights, the statement said. And all
passengers are being "closely
monitored” throughout the ﬂight,

"Any who become symptomatic
will be moved to the specialized
containment area. where they will
be treated," the statement said.

After the ﬂights land, any
passengers that developed
symptoms on the ﬂights and those
who had already tested posttive
will be transported to "an
appropriate location for continued
isolation and care."

NIH Production to ICAN_000557

The remaining passengers will
remain under quarantine for 14
days.

Passengers arriving to Travis Air
Force Base will be housed in the
same facility as evacuees who
arrived from Wuhan earlier this
month, a spokesperson for the
base told CNN, New evacuees will
be kept in a separate area of the
Westwind Inn on the base, the
spokesperson said.

Before the announcement about
the infected ﬂight passengers,
some Americans aboard the
Diamond Princess said they didn't
want to take a chance being
evacuated for fear they would be
subject to possible infection.

Sacramento rcsidcnt Matthew
Smith told CNN afﬁliate KOVR
that he would rather deal with
issues in Japan than be evacuated
and quarantined in the United
States.

"We decided we would just face
whatever consequences here rather
than exposing ourselves to that
situation," Smith told the
affiliate."lt kind of didn't make
any sense if the us was fearful that
these were infected people which
is why they're going to quarantine
them for another 2 weeks to have
thrown them all together"

Smith's wife Katherine Codekas
was met with some surprise when
she told authorities that she and
her husband weren't going to go
with thc other American cvacuccs,
KOVR reported.

NIH Production to ICAN_000558

"They came back around again
and I said no we're not going and
they very sincerely wished us luck
but there was a little look of
surprise on their face," Codekas
explained to the afﬁliate.

“You know, it's not like we're the
last helicopter offthe roof top in
Ho Chi Mihn City," she told
KOVR. "We're on a boat and
we're watching people go away
and people just make different
choices about how they want to
confront the virus."

This is the original graph of Bob
Glass‘ data. He modeled the
various interventions alone or in
combination Along one axis are
the social distancing measures
from doing nothing, to just closing
schools but allowing kids to mix
in the community. to social
distancing of kids in the
community but keeping schools
open, to only social distancing of
adults in the community, to
closing schools and adults social
distancing, to kids and adults
social distancing in the
community, to closing schools and
social distancing of kids in the
community, to a combo of all 3.
Along the other axis are other
interventions including doing
nothing, to quarantine (Q),
treatment of the ill with antivirals
(T). prophylaxis of contacts (P),
and various combinations. We
observed what we called a “cliff
effect” or phase transition or a
discontinuity once you closed
schools and implemented social
distancing among kids. The effect
was non-linear and dramatic. As a
consequence we began a deep dive
to better understand the school
environment (including the

NIH Production to ICAN_000562 ”“001570

transportation system half the
school age kids use each day) and
school age kidsi An unsung hero
in all this was Lisa Koonin (who
was at CDC at the time). If
Richard birthed TLC, Lisa kept
the baby alive in the neonatal
ICUl

We still have much to learn about
this virus. Thus far‘ it seems to be
sparing kids (just like SARS). We
have been monitoring the reports
from China as well as the detailed
data we can see from Hong Kong,
Singapore, and Japanithe
numbers of kids remain very low
and disease appears to be mild.
Nonetheless, TLC (and the NPIs)
is focused on reducing disease
transmission (effectively
decreasing Ro)—the interventions
are really agnostic to severity. It is
Why CDC had to scale the
implementation of TLC (later
called CMG) to severity. Despite
the absence ofsevere disease in
kids, we really are still in the dark
in terms of the amount of
asymptomatic disease or mild sub-
elinical disease in kids because we
just haven’t been able to look.

I never forgot this graph of the
data from Bob Glass and the
inﬂection point that was observed
when the combo of closing
schools and social distancing of
kids was implemented in his
model. Although closing schools
is complicated by its 2‘ml and 3‘01
order impacts‘ it is actually a
pretty clean intervention in tems

NIH Production to ICAN_000563

of actually pulling the trigger
(much cleaner than the other
components of TLC) If this
outbreak proves to be as severe as
our initial estimates, we should
think long and hard before
dismissing the early
implementation of this strategy
(closing schools and social
distancing of kids).

NPIs are going to be central to our
response to this outbreak
(assuming our estimates of
severity prove accurate). This
email group has grown since we
began (not quite epidemic-level
growth, but getting there).
Looking ahead, I anticipate we
might encounter pushback over
the implementation of NPIs and
would expect similar
concerns/arguments as were raised
back in 2006 when this strategy
ﬁrst emerged. It was one of the
reasons I shared the updated data
on US households from American
Community Survey, data on
USDA programs for nutritional
support (including school meal
programs), data on schools and
enrollment, and even data on
juvenile crime, The data that was
gathered back in 2006 on social
density in various environments

NIH Production to ICAN_000565 ””4"”573

(homes, offices/workplaces,
schools, daycare‘ etc.‘ is
unchanged). For additional
background and context. we
attached are 3 papers on NPIs and
TLC for those who are interested.
Richard Ilatchett deserves full
credit for birthing the idea of TLC
(it was actually developed in
response to the threat of H5N1 and
later adopted for pandemic
inﬂuenza response). Duane,
perhaps you can store these
documents on MAX for safe
keeping and access?

The ﬁrst paper is an historical
review of the 1918 pandemic (the
comparison of Philadelphia and
St. Louis is emblematic of the
lesson from 191 8 that timing
matters when deploying NPIsi
need to be early). The second
paper is modeling work that was
done to evaluate these strategies.
At the time, modelers were
focused on how best to contain an
outbreak overseas (really focusing
on using antivirals primarily for
treatment and prophylaxis). 'l'hey
focused their models to evaluate
the effectiveness of various
strategies and quantities of
antiviral medications required to
quench an emerging outbreak
There were 3 groups who were
doing this work back then, They
each present their data in that
paper. A few things to note. In all
the model runs, they did not model
pcrfcction or 100% adherence
(actually far from it), You will see
scenarios from 30/60 (meaning
30% compliance and 60%
ascertainment) on up to 90/80 ).
(See ﬁgures 1) Even leaky
implementation can reduce overall

NIH Production to ICAN_000566

attack rates. The modelers also
looked at timing of
implementation (see ﬁgure 3) At
the time there was a great deal of
skepticismiwas hard for people
to believe this was possible. Or
even ifTLC could be effective,
was implementation practical
given the challenges trying to
implement and the 2nd and 3rd
order consequences (especially of
closing schools). But the
modeling data combined with the
historical data was the tipping
point. Marty Cetron from CDC
and Howard Markel from U of
Michigan. published a more
extensive historical review of the
1918 pandemic showing much the
same. Since then, a group Within
CDC continued to work on this
(collecting additional data from
the 2009 pandemic and
elsewhere), They published an
update ofCMG in MMWR in
2017.

pandemic-ﬂuhtml

The third paper, is a more recent
paper (from 2017) that Richard
shared with rue. The paper is a
little dense, but

I found this paper useful because it
provrdes a vocabulary for
strategies that we have raised
(Symptom Monitoring vs

NIH Production to ICAN_000567

Quarantine ofpolenlially infected
but symptom-free contacts during
an epidemic} This paper
identiﬁes those conditions where
SM or Q is preferred. Figure 1 is
useful for understanding the
challenges given the picture that
seems to be emerging with this
virus. 'l'his outbreak seems closer
to pandemic ﬂu than SARS in
terms of transmission dynamics
(and hence the NPIs we would
need to employ).

Lastly, another person, Bob Glass
at Los Alamos, also did work on
this separately from the MIDAS
group. He actually began this
work as part ofa science fair
project for his daughter (using
social contacts of his daughter and
her classmates at school to model
disease transmission). He knew
someone at VA who forwarded his
work to us (chain of
transmission). Early on (even
before the MIDAS group modeled
TLC), we had a “Eureka” moment
when we graphed his data in Excel
(1 can share that single graph to
anyone interested). Bob Glass was
also interested in trying to
determine when you could let up
on the NPIs during a pandemic.

Subje : RE: Red Dawn
Breaking. COVID-19
Collaborative, Feb 16 start

Hi Carter, great pcinls.

1. Separate current ED/ICU
patients from COVlD-19 is a
must.

NIH Production to ICAN_000572 ”M158“

2, Migrating current ED/ICU
(non-COVID) patients to other
care sites is great idea.

3. Caring for COVID—lQ
patients:leveraging ED/ICU
personnel for high compliance and
usage oflimited resources (PPE
everything that goes with it) is
very critical. Strategic usage and
minimizing non—medical staff is
necessary --— either these operators
are welletrained and protected, or
they cannot be there.

4. Concentrating care within
ED/ICU for COVID-I9 ensures
rapid learning and sharing of
knowledge among workers as they
take care of these patients,
Clearly from the standpoint of
data collection and clinical
symptoms recording and
organization. it is more feasible
and allow for immediate analysis
and feedback.

5. Strategic prioritization of
limited resources is extremely
important. We must do it now,
because the supply chain is
already being affected and it can
go worse,

6. Primary care and call centers
are good. If you want to do
strategic testing, this is also a good
place to involve.

NIH Production to ICAN_000573

7. So few children are reported
among the conﬁrmed positive
cases. They may be good
Spreaders (not necessarily have to
be super) and the more vulnerable
people would be ones show up
with symptomatic disease
characteristics (or no/mild
symptoms)

Best, Eva

Wanted to bounce

group

I have been ooncemed
about some of the
preparedness efforts
of healthcare systems

NIH Production to ICAN_000574 ””1582

NIH Production to ICAN_000575

as they are ramping
up their capabilities to
care for patients with
COVlD-19 presenting
anywhere in their
system. Staff
working in ERs and
ICUs are pretty
familiar with the care
of these types of
patients and the use of
appropriate PPE
(standard contact and
airbome precautions
including eye
protection). The staff
at the hospitals
undergo fit testing for
respirators, etc. Staff
in outpatient clinics
(especially remote
community based
outpatient clinics)
don’t typically
undergo ﬁt testing for
respirators. So ERs
and ICUs have
muscle memory for
isolating patients and
providing care to
patients with
infectious respiratory
disease. Community
based outpatient
clinics do not.

As part of the
preparedness efforts,
there has been interest
in fit testing
outpatient clinic staff
and supplying these
clinics with PPE and
establishing
procedures for

NIH Production to ICAN_000576

evaluating COVID-19
patients in the
community based
clinics, Given the
projected shortages of
PPE, thatjust doesn’t
seem like the most
prudent approach,

Raﬁier than expand
the care of potential
COVID-19 patients to
community based
outpatient clinics, I
would focus on
hospital care-~ERs
and inpatient areas
(especially ICUs). I
would not pursue ﬁt
testing for staff
working in outlying
clinics. As a strategy.
I suggested dividing
COVID patients into
two categoriesiﬂ)
those with illness that
is mild enough to be
cared for at home
(self care or care by
other family
members); or (2)
those who are sick
enough to be seen in
the ER for possible
hospitalization. I
would refocus the
efforts of outlying
clinics away from
COVID and toward
keeping non-COVID
patients with the usual
mix of acute and
chronic illnesses we
see from hypertension
to (‘HF to diabetes,

NIH Production to ICAN_000577

elu, out ol‘lhe ER and
out of the hospital.
That is what they can
do to help unburden
ERS and hospitals for
the surge in COVID
patients in ERs and
hospitals, I would
leverage telephone
care as much as
possible to handle
patients with mild
disease seeking care
related to COVID
(and quickly develop
algorithms to
determine who has
mild disease and can
be managed by
telephone at home
and who needs lo
evaluated in the ER).
Think of it like the
program Lisa
developed for
pandemic inﬂuenza
(Nurse On Call) on
steroids, minus the
antivxral piece, Could
we repurpose and
leverage that program
for COVID? Such a
strategy would help to
conserve our PPE
supply (avoid the
expansion of ﬁt
testing and the
redirection of already
limited supplies of
PPE to outlying
clinics) and not ask
outlying clinics to do
something they don’t
typically do (that
usually doesn’t out
turn out very well). If

NIH Production to ICAN_000578

the outlying clinics
focused on what they
normally do (caring
for patients with
chronic diseases),
they could help the
ER and hospitals cope
with the demands of
COVIU. 1 would
think about Urgent
Care centers in the
same wayito help to
decompress ERs.

I also think that we
need to start thinking
about strategies to
conserve PPE for
hospitals. I’m
concerned about the
projected burn rates
and the supply chains
for PPE. Click on
Amazon and check
out the prices now.
Or click on WalMart
(can’t pick up any
masks from WalMart
now). I saw one
supplier selling 200
surgical masks on
WalMart’s site for
only $459.99. Such a
deal.

As a conservation
strategy, we might
think about limiting
the amount of staff
interacting with
infected patients and
cohorling patients
(even thinking of
strategies to minimize
need for

NIH Production to ICAN_000579

housekeeping or [boil
service or lab services
from entering areas
with COVID patients-
-think Ebola-like
strategies (not out of
concern ofdisease
transmission but
Simply to limit
number of staff to
conserve PPE).
Could do something
similar with ERs
(akin to what
pediatricians do to
separate sick call
patients from other
appointments). I
have recommend
prioritizing PPE for
EDS and ICUs as well
as speciﬁc inpatient
areas where we would
likely initially cohort
patients, not pursuing
ﬁt testing of
outpatient clinic staff,
and shifting patients
with mild COVID
disease to telephone
care and away from
outpatient clinics.

I know several ofyou
are part of large
healthcare systems,
Am curious how
others are
approaching this
challenge,

I am also resending
the questions I posed

NIH Production to ICAN_000580

for handling sick
Eli/hospital staff or
staff members with a
conﬁrmed case of
COVID in their
household. Caner

in many parts of China and many countries in the
world, with meaningful numbers of secondary

Update on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan

We commend the extraordinary efforts by the Government of Japan to institute quarantine
measures onboard the Diamond Princess. While the quarantine potentially conferred :1
Signiﬁcant public health beneﬁt in slowing transmission, CDC’s assessment is that it may not
have been sufﬁcient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship. CDC believes the
rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms. represents an
ongoing riski Therefore, to protect the health of the American public, all passengers and crew of
the ship have been placed under travel restrictions, preventing them from retuming to the Enited
States for at least 14 days after they had leﬂ the Diamond Princess.

Currently, there are more than l00 US. citizens still onhoard the Diamond Princess cruise ship
or in hospitals in Japan. These citizens have been placed under the restrictions, as have the ship’s
other passengers and crew.

After disembarkation from the Diamond Princess, these passengers and crew will be required to
wait 14 days without having symptoms or a positive coronavirus test result before they are
permitted to board ﬂights to the United States.

If an individual from this cruise arrives in the United States before the 14-day period ends, they
will still be subject to a mandatory quarantine until they have completed the [4-day period with
no symptoms or positive coronavirus test results.

Because of their high-risk exposure, there may be additional contimied eases ofCOVlD-l9
among the remaining passengers on board the Diamond Princess,

CDC is committed to protecting the health and safety of all Americans. We continue to believe
that the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to the general public in the United States is currently

low The US Government is taking these measures to protect the Diamond Princess passengers
and crew, their loved ones, the traveling public, and communities within the United States.

Subject: WaPo - fact check on coronavirus story
Hey Caitlin and Katie,

Happy Friday! I’m working on a story about the coronavirus response, aiming to publish tomorrow. The
story is about how President Trump has praised China and President Xi, but that has made some of his
advisors uncomfortable given the lack of transparency from China and the inability to get CDC scientists
in to the country. We also have some details about the response and the task force, and some
disagreements that have arisen. I’ve listed the points we have in the story that pertain to HHS— would
you be able to take a look, let me know if there are any issues and potentially provide a comment? I
included some quotes from Sec. Azar’s interviews on Friday with CNN and CNBC but also happy to
include a quote from the agency.

NIH Production to ICAN_000609 N'H‘mm

I realize I'm sending this at the end of the day. so would it be possible for you to get back to me by 1 pm
tomorrow? Let me know what works on your end. Thanks so much.

- President Trump has lavished praise on China and its ruler, XiJinping, for its handling of the
growing coronavirus outbreak — a posture some in his administration are growing increasingly
uncomfortable with as his advisors remain concerned about China’s transparency and handling
of the epidemic.

- Trump’s praise towards Xi has rked some advisors, who say those comments and othersabout
how the virus will likely behave reflect how the president is being briefed, underscoring tensions
within the administration over its handling of the outbreak and the message it should be
sending to the American public.

0 Worries about the market and tenuous negotiations with China over a trade deal have played a
large role in influencing Trump's friendly posture.

- Trump has told advisors he does not want the administration to do or say anythingthat would
further spook the markets, but remains worried that any largerscale outbreak in the U.S. could
hurt his reelection bid.

I For weeks, the administration’s messaging was that the threat to the American public remained
low and the virus was not spreading within communities. But some advisors pushed for a more
balanced message because they expect there to eventually be some community spread as the
outbreak grows, and the administration has since adjusted its message to reflect that.

0 In an effort to keep Trump calm and restrained, A1ar has been briefing the president that
"everything is under control, totally under control," which has kept Trump from doing or saying
anythingdrastic.

- HHS officials have also told Trump that the number of infections could go down in the spring
when it gets warmer, which is mainly an educated guess.

- Some officials have complained that Trump‘s comments emanate from his briefings with Azar,
who they say has sought to control the response. He has told other doctors. including Anthony
Faucl, not to get too far Into the details ofthe virus and outbreak with Trump. Instead, Azar has
instructed doctors to let him handle it.

- Azar has also wanted to be the one to announce major updates about the administration's
response to the virus. On Thursday. he briefed the Senate Finance Committee that the CDC
would use public health labs infive cities that normally test for influenza to also test for
coronavirus, taking state health officials by surprise.

- Some officials said the response has become smoother and better coordinated in recent weeks.

There are new indications that the incubation period for the virus could be longer than the currently
believed 14 days, with patients testing positive after much longer quarantine periods. This development
came as infections rose in South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy andthe head of the World Health
Organization warned that the window for stopping the epidemic was narrowing.

Here's what we know:

achinese leader Xi Jinping has been advised that the situation in Wuhan “remains grim and complex."
oSouth Korea and Japan both reported a sharp spike in cases Saturday, with the numberof cases in
South Korea doubling in a day. A fiith person died in Iran from the virus, while Italy now has 50
confirmed cases, making it the largest hot spot in Europe.

uChina reported only 397 new cases Saturday, as the rate of increase continued to decline, but an
additional 109 people have died. There continues to be a grgr deal o‘slze CEELMI China:
numeeﬁ as the criteria for diagnosing coronavirus keep changing.

IA team of international epidemic experts had Wuhan added to their itinerary in China, following
questions about why they wouldn't go to the center of the coronavirus outbreak that has caused more
than 2,000 deaths in the country.

ISCientiStS in China saidthey had isolated coronavirus strains in urine, raising the possibility that it
might be transmissible that way, as well as through fecal matter and respiratory droplets.

BEIJING — Scientists are studying reports that the incubation period for coronavirus could be longer
than the currently believed 14 days, potentially casting doubt on current quarantine criteria for
containing the virus amid an increasingly urgent effort to stop the epidemic from spreading in northeast
Asia and across the world.
South Korea and Japan both reported a sharp spike in cases Saturday, while in China, an additional 109
people died and a fifth person died from the virus in Iran. Italian authorities on Saturday said the
Country was seeing a sudden rise in coronavuus cases, wilh roughly 50 confirmed in the past two days
— an outbreak that represents the largest yet across Europe.
Meanwhile, scientists in China reported indications that the virus might be transmissible through urine.
A team of experts from the World Health Organization was due to arrive Saturday in Wuhan, the
epicenter ofthe coronavirus outbreak.
WHO directorAgeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday stressed the urgency of containing the
spread of the coronavirus, after cases were reported earlier in Iran and Lebanon.
"Although the window ofopportunity is narrowing to contain the outbreak, we still have a chance to
contain it,” he told reporters in Geneva. “ifwe don’t, ifwe squanderthe opportunity, then there will be
a serious problem on our hands.”
Chinese leader XiJinping, who has not visited Wuhan since the outbreak began, was briefed that the
situation in the city and in surrounding Hubei province “remains grim and complex,” according to a
report by the official Xinhua News Agency published Saturday.
“The nationwide inflection point of the epidemic has not yet arrived,” the report said after a meeting of
Communist Party leaders
China’s National Health Commission reported Saturday that 397 new cases of coronavirus had been
diagnosed Friday, taking the total to more than 76,000. The rate of infection outside Hubei appears to
have slowed markedly, although there has been a great deal of confusion about the statistics this week
as officials have repeatedly changed the criteria for confirming cases.
Among the new cases discovered Friday were a 70-year-old man in Hubei who was confirmed as
mn Jia ngxi province tested positive after—

at home. On Thursday, authorities reported that a man
in Hubei had tested positive for coronavirus afterwhat appeared to be with
no symptoms.
Coronavirus cases in South Korea skyrocket; cases triple in Japan
In Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Saturday that 229 additional
cases of the coronavirus had been detected, taking the total to 433, more than doubling in the space of
a day, This makes it the worst-affected country outside China,
"Apart from the Diamond Princess cruise Ship, :South] Korea now has the most cases outside China, and
we’re working closely with the government to fully understand the transmission dynamics that led to
this increase,” Ted ros said,
The majority of the new cases have been traced to existing clusters at a church in southern city of Daegu
and a hospital in nearby Cheongdo County, according to the KCDC.
The South Korean government has designated Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang provmce as
"special care zones” where containment efforts and support will be concentrated.

More than half of South Korea’s cases are connected to Daegu branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus
the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.

Since members of the church attended a funeral at nearby Cheongdo Daenam hospital, 111 coronavirus
cases have been reported there, including two patients who died from the virus,

NIH Production to ICAN_000614

The mass infection at the hospital is centered on its locked psychiatric ward, where a confined
environment could have aggravated transmissions, said Jung Eun-Kyeong, director of the KCDC,

A man in his 405 was found dead at his home in city of Gyeongju, east of Daegu, after becoming infected
with the virus. He is the third person to die from the virus in South Korea.

Trumeas not told coronavirus-infected Americans would be flown home from cruise ship

In Japan, the number of coronavirus cases rose to 121 on Saturday, more than tripling in a week. That
number excludes the 634 people on board the Diamond Princess who contracted the virus.

One of the latest cases was a teacher in her 605 at a publicjunior high school east ofTokyo, who
complained ofnausea while working. The mayor of Chiba city said the school will be closed until
Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK reported.

The teacher had not traveled abroad In the past two weeks and has no record of haying been In contact
with a known infected person, underlining the fact that the virus is now spreading almost invisibly
throughout the country, experts say.

Quarantines in effect in parts of Italy amid sudden spike in cases

As numbers suddenly rose in Italy, the government has scrambled to contain the new outbreak, asking
some 50,000 people to stay indoors and suspending all public events ~ including religious ceremonies
and school e in 10 small towns to the south of Milan.

Until a few days ago, Italy had seen only three confirmed infections, including a pair of Chinese tourists,
"There is quite an evident contagion, a very strong one,” said Giulio Gallera, health chief of the northern
Lombardy region, which has seen the majority of the cases.

Italian officials on Friday attributed the country’s first death to the coronavirus, and on Saturday said
that a 77-year-old woman had also tested positive for the virus after being found dead in her home. But
Italian authorities said the woman suffered from other health conditions, and were unsure if it was the
virus that had killed hers

As of Saturday afternoon, there were 39 confirmed cases in the prosperous Lombardy region, which
includes the country’s financial hub, Milan There were another 12 cases in the neighboring northern
region of Veneto.

The regional president of Veneto, Luca Zaia, said it is becoming harder to figure out how the virus is
jumping from one place to the next.

”It goes to show you that having other cases of contagion is absolutely possible,” Zaia said.

According to Italian media reports, one of the ﬁrst peopleto come down with the virus was a 387yeare
old who’d had dinner with somebody who hadjust come back from China. But some three weeks passed
between that dinner and the time the man came down with a fever. In between, he ran a half-
marathon, played soccer and traveled to several towns, according to La Repubblica, a major italian
daily.

Iran, meanwhile, announced its fifth death from the virus, raising the country’s overall total confirmed
cases to twenty eight.

Efforts to clear the Diamond Princess cruise ship continue

Meanwhile, tests are continuing on the crew members on board the Diamond Princess. At least 74 crew
members have so far been found to have the Virus.

All of the passengers have now been tested and almost all have left the ship, either to go home if they
tested negative, to local hospitals or govern merit facilities if they have the virus, or back to their home
countries.

Some passengers were asked to stay on board to serve an additional quarantine if theircabin mate
contracted the virus, but this group is also disembarking Saturday to serve out the rest of their
quarantine in a government facility, local media reported.

More than 200 port calls in Japan by international cruise ships have been canceled since the beginning
of February due to the coronavirus outbreak, a Kyodo News survey showed Saturday, with the lost
revenue from passengers coming ashore dealing another blow to Japan’s weak economy.

Controversy continues to simmer about the infection control procedures on board the ship, after a
doctor complained on Tuesday about ”chaotic’l and scan/ conditions on board,

Six people working on the boat or With the passengers, including four government officials, a medic and
an ambulance driver, have contracted the virus.

Media reports questioned why about 90 government officials who worked on the ship have returned to
work without being tested for the coronavirus. Asked about this, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said
the government is ”trying to confirm what operations staff were involved in specifically."

American woman in Malaysia declared free of coronavirus

The 83Ayearaold woman who tested positive for the coronaVirus when she arrived at Kuala Lumpur
airport after disembarking in Cambodia from the MS Westerdam cruise ship has recovered, Malaysia
health authorities said Saturday.

The woman ”is showing good improvement and signs or recovery, however, she is still being monitored
and managed in hospital fora slight cough,” Malaysia's director general of health, Noor Hisham
Abdullah, said in a statement.

The woman repeatedly tested negative while on board the ship and when she disembarked in
Sihanoukville, then twice tested positive while transiting in Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 15, That set off
a global scramble to track the hundreds of other passengerswho had also disembarked then boarded
planes bound for home.

The woman was taken to a hospital and given antiviral treatment and supplementary oxygen, and she
showed improvement after 72 hours of treatment initiation, Abdullah said, Two more tests, conducted
24 hours apart, both came back negative forcoronavirus.

Butthe US. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cast doubt on whether the woman was ever
infected, saying she "never had coronavirus to our knowledge.”

"l have conﬁrmed that all the passengers were tested, and they have come back negative for
coronavirus, including the person who initially tested positive,” USA Today Quoted CDC spokesperson
Richard Quartarone as saying. The woman "may have had a respiratory illness, but if she did, it was not
covid-lQ," he said, using the official name for the virus.

Cambodia’s Ministry of Health had previously cleared the 747 crew members who were still on board
the Westerdam and the 781 passengers who were still in the country of coronavirus infection,
Chinese scientists isolate coronavirus strains in urine as WHO prepares visit
Separately, scientists in China are continuing to study how the virus is transmitted.

A research team led by renowned Chinese pulmonologischong Nanshan had isolated live coronavirus
strains in urine samples from infected patients, Zhao Jincun, a respiratory expert at the State Key
Laboratory, told reporters in Guangdong on Saturday.

The team of scientists had previously said the virus, in addition to being carried in respiratory droplets,
appeared to be transmissible through fecal rriatter, underscoring the need to practice good hand
washing as a preventive measure.

Zhao did not directly say that the virus could be transmitted through urine, simply noting that the strains
had been isolated and that this had implications for public health control. Theyare continuing to work
on isolating the Virus and on a cure, the Guangzhou Daily reported.

But he said people should pay more attention to personal and family hygiene to prevent the spread of
the virus and recommended frequently washing hands, closing the toilet lid before flushing and making
sure bathroom drains are not blocked.

WHO experts have also been on an investigative mission in China this week, holding meetings in Beijing
and traveling to the provinces ofSichuan and Guangdong. But they had not been scheduled to travel to
Wuhan, where the outbreak began at a live animal market and which remains understrict lockdown in
an effort to contain the virus.

This had led to speculation that the Chinese government, which has come under fire for its slow
response to the outbreak and where medical workers are stretched to the limit, did not want the
experts to visit.

But the WHO said late Friday that the experts would be traveling to the center of the outbreak on
Saturday, although they gave no further information about their itinerary.

Harlan and Stefano Pltrelll In Rome contributed reporting.

Dear Anne and Tony,

I am sorry to botheryou, but I am hoping that you can direct me to anyone at NIAID or CDC who is
working on the sun/ival of Covid-19 on surfaces. This could include shipping boxes, but also on various
products and other perishable items. The food safety people here at FDA are quite concerned about the
latter, given published reports of differential coronavirus survival on various surfaces.

If it turns out that this has not been evaluated, or is not in the process of being evaluated, we are happy
to work on this in our ESL-3 labs, which are now in receipt of the virus.

Tony,

I expect you know Dr. Richard Tubb. He and I worked closely together in the White House 18 years ago. I
have a lot of confidence in his judgment, and therefore am forwarding the materials he sent me for your
consideration.

I know nothing about the technologies involved, but I know this is a time to write off no good options.

Warm regards,

Thanks for the note and the offer to help. It would be great if you could tweet to your many
Twitter followers that although the current risk of coronavirus to the American public is low,
the fact that there is community spread of virus in a number ofcountries besides China and
Including South Korea, Japan, Italy, lran among others poses a rlskthat we may progress to a
global pandemic of COVlD-19. If that occurs we will surely have many more cases in the USA.
And so forthat reason, the American public should not be frightened, but should be prepared
to mitigate an outbreak in this country by measures that include social distancing, teleworking,
temporary closure of schools, etc. There is nothing to be done right now since there are so few
cases in this country and these cases are being properly isolated, and so go about your daily
business. However, be aware that behavioral adjustments may need to be made if a pandemic

occurs,

(POC) Coronayirus detection/ viral load monitoring/ Followup to our meeting
at the ASPEN ideas festival -

Dea r Dr. Anthony Fauci,

It was a great pleasure meeting you all a couple of years ago when we were both speaking
at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Some of my contacts at the CDC recently briefed me about the
rapidly emerging threat of the coronavirus to the US and have been urging us to develop
an app for detecting coronavirus with high sensitivity and specificity on ourGenerRADAR
platform. Our platform has the ability to quantify viral loads in ‘real-time’ which would be a
much more precise and accurate solution in deciding quarantine than the current
thermometers or even the current CDC coronavirus test which has a very poor Limit of
detection (ie low sensitivity).

We have a strong track record of responding to previous pandemic threats and rapidly
building Gene RADAR applications for Ebola and Zika and then gettingthem through
clinical validation as per the the FDA EUA approval process. Our Gene-RADAR Zika test was
FDA EUA certified right as the Zika crisis was coming to an end.

I would love to work with you to see how we can help in your efforts to rapidly respond to
this deadly threat to the US andthe world. Here are some of the capabilities of our
platform that we believe could be an enabler for helping to stop this out break from
becoming a full-fledged global pandemic.

NIH Production to ICAN_000655 ”Mum”

- Gene~RADAR platform for Real time Mobile [POO Coronavirus detection/viral load
monitoring

0 Highlysensitive and specifici minimize false positives and false negatives

0 With very good LOD’s we could potentially start to catch people
presymptomatically and enable the early detection , early quarantine
would limit the spread and early intervention could lead to better
outcomes

0 More precise viral load monitoring could help determine when to release
people from quarantine or ICU beds

0 Our platform‘s ability to quantify vial loads could change clinical trial
endpoints for new drug candidates or (repurposed drug formulations),
thereby accelerating FDA approvals for novel therapeutic regimen

0 We already have an ISO 13485 certified manufacturing facility (currently in
Boston) that we are prepared to move as fast as possible to ramp up our
production
We would love to work with you to repurpose our FDA approved platform
for the above coronavirus applications assay and help your noble efforts
to stop this outbreak from becoming a full blown global pandemic that
could costs thousands of lives and cause trillions of dollars of economic
damage to the global economy.

We would love to speak with you to brlef on our capa bllltles and discuss how we can
qualify for some of the emergency funding being made available to help tackle this
pandemic threat.

Happy tojump on a phone call to discuss further how we can help

Subject: Seeking Drt Fa uci for coronavirus webinar

Patricia:

I hope you are doing well. Dr. Fauci has been a wonderful speaker for us in the past, and
I'm reaching out to him today for a discussion on coronavirus,

When there are major news stories, we often will try to do a live webinaron the topic with
a leading expert or two,

NIH Production to ICAN_000672 ""wmm

This is something we would do in ourstudio at our office near Dupont Circle‘ We normally
do them for 45-60 minutes, and we take questions (visa Twitter) from our audience, The
audience would be reporters who coverthe topic, as well as others interested in the topic.
it is a way to have an in-depth, thoughtful conversation about a pressing topic.

Here are a couple we’ve done (the first is on Zika a few years ago):

Zika panel discussion: https://nationalpressorE/tonic understandingrtherzikor
threat[?st=0&t=&mm=Video

Ted Koppel: https: /nationa|press.org/toolbox-topic/lHints-out-risks-to-the-power-
grld(?st=7042&mm=VIdeo

Autonomous vehicles panel discussion: https:[Znationalpress.orgztopiqwhats-new-with—

autonomous-vehicleS/?st=8474&t=Automation&mm=Storv

We’d like to do one of these on coronaVirus. We'd love to have Dr. Fauci as our prime
guest.

We can schedule it around his demands, but would of course love to do it as soon as
possible.

We know he is in demand at this moment. But he is such a singular expert on the topic
we’d love to have a discussion with him — one that would help get his message out to
journalists (and others) who need to be informed to best cover the topic.

Is it possible to check with Dr. Fauci to see if this is possible?

Thanks,

Chris Adams

Many thanks for your quick reply and for the clear list of responses regarding the proof. I
will review today and will let you know if there are any items needing further discussion.

The current plan is for publication early Friday afternoon. As I mentioned yesterday, there
is a new article on Covid-19 that is also scheduled for publication that day, and the Journal
editors would like you to mention it in your editorial. I expect to be able to send you a
proof of that article sometime today.

distinguished organization of nearly 1600 global executives and senior leaders.
Our C»level global membership would appreciate getting your perspectives on the
coronavirus outbreak. We are open to topics which could include..,.What we
know and don’t know...As business and community leaders what SIBF members
can do to prepare and educate their employees...Safety of travel, etc.

We were thinking the webinar could be approximately 30 minutes in length (15

minutes of remarks followed by 15 minutes of Q&A). SlBF’s Communications
Manager could work with someone on yourteam to set-up the webinar. SIBF is a

Dear Dr Fauci.

Many thanks for your quick reply and for the clear list of responses regarding the proof. I will review
today and will let you know if there are any items needing further discussion.

The current plan is for publication early Friday afternoon. As I mentioned yesterday, there is a new
article on Covid-19 that is also scheduled for publication that day, and the Journal editors would like you
to mention it in your editorial. I expect to be able to send you a proof of that article sometime today.

Dear Nehal.

With the coronavirus bordering on a pandemic and the expectation that it will affect the US at some
point, it seems to me we should be prepared to provide guidance to patients who are on immune
modulators for inflammatory disease. Specifically, many will wonder if patients should stop their
biologic if the virus becomes prevalent in their community. There will also be questions about stopping
biologic: in the setting of acute infection with coronavirus.

Any thoughts on this? My specific interests relates to patients With psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis on
biologics but it’s also relevant to patients with IBD, RA and other inflammatory diseases.

Hi Tony,

I'm sure you know Michael Milken. I've worked with him over many years, and though he
is a somewhat controversial figure he has certainly helped NIH in many ways‘ He reached
out to me last night to ask if there is anything he could do to help with the coronavirus
vaccine effort. He had seen press reports that findinga pharma partner had been
challenging Aand wanted to volunteer his help in that regard, since he has deep
connections in the private sector. He also said that he’d be glad to help with any
philanthropic needs, both through his own resources and his influence over members of
the lemg Pledge.

Are there useful actions that I can suggest to him?

Sincerly,

1/You said on CNN that US have had pandemic preparedness plan that developed in preparation for
pandemic influenza. Could you provide some details of this plan? The plan outlines the differences
between containment and mitigation. It speaks of the thing that should be done if an outbreak
occurs in the USA. The; inclue social distancing, use of telecommunication and telework. temporarily
closing schools, avoiding crowed places such as indoor arenas and theaters.

2/To prepare for potential communities spread of coronavirus in US, do you think that US need take the
measures similar with China? China was in the ”reactive" mode of responding to an explosion of cases
in Wuhan City and Hubei province with spread throughout China. China had to resort to very
dramatic measures such as shutting down cities. The USA is now in a preparative mode and not a
reactive mode and so our response is much dlﬂ‘erent than that of China.

The message would have to be that the situation continues to evolve and people need to follow the news and the
reports from coo. For example, a few weeks ago ifyou wanted to travel to Japan or South Korea, it was ﬁne since
there were few is any cases there. Now both countries have a travel alert that says "Avoid all but essential travel“.
You should tell people that travel to places with few or no reported cases is fine, Only when you have community
spread (person to person to person) should you be concerned about a speciﬁc travel destination Also. you could
explain to people that pandemics evolve when a new infectious disease is spreading b) ustained community spread
in multiple countries in different regions ofthe globe. Once a pandemic erupts. it is Virtually impossible for any
country to be free of cases. People need to understand that. You can mitigate the effects. but you cannot avoid
having infections since you cannot shut offthe country from the rest of the world. Also, you need to speak of the
real and present danger of seasonal inﬂuenza every year. Do not let the fear of the unknown (i.c. a pandemic of a
new infectious agent) distort your evaluation of the risk ofth pandemic to you relatiu: to the risks that you face
every day. The only thing that we can do is to prepare as best as possible and do not yield to unreasonable fear.

i would love to give some logical travel advice. i know there are so many unknowns. but [ have had multiple people

I was Just watching the HHS brieﬁng online, and thinking about an article I read this
morning, and Bruce Aylward's description of what he saw in China, and a lot of
videos I've watched on the South China Morning Post website (they‘re doing great
coverage).

In China, we in the media tend to report the horrors and the lockdown and the
government's early lies...

But the truth is that a lot of average Chinese behaved incredibly heroically in the
face of the virus: 25,000 doctors and nurses went into Wuhan to help, knowing they
might die Average people gave up Iheir stockpiles of masks so they could be
shipped to Wuhan. Neighborhood committees brought food to thousands oflittle old
ladies and checked on them every day, even as they asked them to stay behind their
doors for fear of infection.

Meanwhile. in America. people tend to act like selﬁsh pigs interested only in saving
themselves. How can I hoard a mask? Where's my vaccine? This morning, I

read this apgalling article from Alabama. Here you have Americans coming back
from a horrifying experience overseas, and the President -- who is popular in
Alabama -- asks Alabamans to take some of those fellow Americans in. There is
zero risk because they're going to be housed on a naval base.

And yet. the answer is "No! Keep them out!" And their legislators encourage it...

I dunno -- that's the kind of behavior I expect from my fellow New Yorkers, not
from Alabama.

lfthe virus arrives -- and we both know it will -— America is going to have to do
better than that. Like the Chinese, Americans are going to have to look out for each
other the way we haven't since 9/11. Or maybe since World War [1.

But that's not thc tone of the HHS brieﬁngs. They're an aggressive, defensive,
almost smart-alecky "we got this" tone. The only time the tone was right when you

were the third lo take the mike and explain things to that kid shouting from the back
without a mike about "What's the real message? What do we do?"

Maybe there could be some thought given to mentally preparing Americans to work
together in the face ofthe crisis? Quarantines are a very aggressive approach -- but

they require a lot of compassion or the people quarantined suffer.

I might get around to writing an article about this, but my editors keep grabbing me
for minute by minute stuff and 1m way behind,

Subject: Surfactant Protein-l) against coronavirus

Dear Dr, Fauci,

We are developing a recombinant human form of Surfactant Protein-D (AT-100), an
endogenous collectin with strong immune—modulatory properties. AT- 100 shows
anti-inﬂammatory and anti-infectious properties

 

While we are discussing this with a number of academic institutions, I was
wondering, though, whether you and the NIH are interested to collaborate on
evaluating AT-lOO against coronavirus. Please let me know, if you are Willing to
schedule a phone call with our Chief Medical Ofﬁcer Dr. Paul Kingma and l to
discuss. There is obviously a sense of urgency behind this request

Hello Dr. Fauci,

I know you are extremely busy and will get right to the point. I would like to join the
coronavirus taskforce.

I worked on the Ebola task force about six years ago, which had a similar sense of urgency,
and recognize that assembling a SWAT team overnight is critically important in order to
monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, notjust tor the United States,
but on a worldwide basis

I've done a significant amount of work in infectious disease vaccine development at a
number of biotech ﬁrms (Vical, Inovio and Intrexon) in partnership with the NIH, Vaccine
Research Center, DOD and the CDC.

I also 00(6) we discuss preparedness on a daily basis. Those
conversations clearly indicate that the knowledge and expertise is severely lacking at both
the academic medical center level. as well as the community health level,

I believe my assistance can be deployed in several areas where my experience in virology,
immunology, antivirals, Ebola, product development and strategic partnering could be of
immediate value to research scientists, medical professionals and healthcare systems.

1. Identification of emerging therapeutics.

2. Fast track emerging therapeutics from pre-clinicat to IND and fast-track clinical trials,

3. Identity opportunities to accelerate the production of commercial quantities of therapeutic
material.

4. Identity unique genomic ﬁngerprints of responders and patients undergoing treatment to
guide therapeutic selection and optimize interventions.

5. Interface with public and/or institutional stakeholders on a worldwide basis (24/7)
regarding safety procedures, diagnostics, therapeutic interventions. etc.

6. Other initiatives, representing areas where there is an immediate need to bring on board
and deploy an indiwdual With deep expertise. who can prOVIde leadership, drop in and
rapidly advance those initiatives.

Dear Dr Fauci,
Trust this mail finds you well.

I have a few questions regarding the Moderna vaccine, which it would be great to get your
input on.

is it true that trials of the possible vaccine Will start in April, but that, even if the first study
is positive, the vaccine might not become widely available until next year because of the
need for further studies and regulatory clearances?

The company is characterizing this as a vaccine. Strictly speaking, what should it be
referred to as?

If you have time for a quick telephone call this morning as soon as you’re able that would
be great.

To gel 1 million deaths of 1957 would require 200 million infections at a
death rate of 0.5%. That seems high number of infections.

But what is the worldwide seasonal flu death numbers if the USA has 50,000
deaths in a bad year and the 1957 number of deaths was 116,000? The
WHO says 650,000 deathsworldwide from seasonal flu. So this could be
worse but by about 40% not an order of magnitude. Okay so I should be
more concerned.

And do you think it will go down in late spring with warmer weather?

Ari is also calling me frequently. The virus has adapted itself very well
to humans with considerable community transmission (certainly in
China) now in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy,
etc. If it continues to spread via multiple generations of human to
human transmission, then we will not be able to avoid considerable
amounts of infections and spread in the USA. Seasonal influenza has a
mortality of 0.1%. The calculated mortality of COVlD-19 to about 2.5
%. It is probably lower since the denominator is likely larger than we
appreciate due to asymptomatic infections, Even ifthe mortality goes
down to 0.5%, that is still equivalent to a pandemic influenza of 1957
or 1968. In other words, it could be worse than you think.

less than flu. Also travel restrictions are delaying but not stopping virus.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Greetings and thank you for all your outstanding scientiﬁc and policy leadership regarding the evolving
Covid-19 situation.

I am writing to you from South Korea where, as you well know, we are experiencing a very difficult
phase of the epidemic. Among the several groups I have been engaged with to address this crisis, I am
working with the genome sequencing company, Macrogen, which you may already be familiar wwth
(https:([dnamacrogencomkggz . Dr. Jeongsun Seo, the Chairman of Macrogen. along with other
company leaders and myselfhave been discussing

 

NIH Production to ICAN_000733 Nlnnmam

 

Barring the institution of any extreme travel restrictions, I am planning to visit the Bethesda area next
week (Macrogen US. HQ is located in Rockville). I know you are extraordinarily busy but if you (or key
colleagues) have time, land other senior Macrogen colleagues would be happy to discuss the project, its
necessary next steps, along with any other matters related to Korea as you wish. [Please note that I do
not have any clinical symptoms or signs of Covid-19 nor any relevant contact history.]

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter and I hope that we may have a chance to advance
this important project together.

Please take care and thanks again,

Ogan

Hi Jason,

Hope you have/had safe travels to DC this week! I wanted to check in to
confirm that you’re still planning on coming to visit us at NIH this Friday?

Currently, Dr. Myles is holding 10am and Dr. Beikaid is holding 1:30pm to
discuss their microbiome-related research with you. Dr. Fauci’s schedule
has been very fluid lately due to the coronavirus outbreak~we'll likely need
to check in with his assistant Patty Conrad on Thursday to see how his
Friday calendar looks (unless you hear otherwise from Patty directly).

Best.

Sounds good — I’ll ask Dr. Myles to hold 10am, so you can chat
with him before you meet Dr. Fauci at 11. We can re-confirm
timing closer to the date. I’ll tag along, and can make sure you
get where you need to — you’ll get to visit several different
buildings, fortunately all close by!

Hi Jason.

Great speaking with you last week. I wanted to follow
up to let you know that Yasmine Belkaid and Ian
Myles—whose work we discussed on host-microbe
interactions and developing a bacteria-based
treatment for eczema, respectively—are willing to
meet with you on Feb. 28.

Here are links to some background info:

- Dr. Belkaid‘s lab gage, and recent NIAID grass
release about a skin microbiome study from
her lab

0 Dr. Myles' lab page, and NIAID press release

about findings from a Ph 1/2 trial assessing the
R. mucosa treatment for eczema

Dr. Belkaid is available at 1:30pm (her building is next
to the Clinical Center, where you'll be meeting with
Julie Segre I believe trom 12-1ish). Dr. Myles‘
schedule is a bit more flexible, and he’s currently

W The secret to
Madonna’s staying
power

may be surprismgly
simple: gardening.
What the pop star
does involves no
trowel or soil.
Thanks

to dishes of
fermented soy
beans, millet and
brown rice prepared
by her personal
chef, Mayumi
Nishimura,
Madonna practices
a form

of inner horticulture
-- cultivating her
intestlnal flora in a
burgeoning
alternative
approach to health.
Studies of the
trillions of bacteria
living on and in the
body suggest the
Material Girl, 53,
may be onto
something. By
eatlng foods rich in
ﬁber and laced with
so-called good

NIH Production to ICAN_000778

bacteria, she may
be encouraging
helpful microbes to
ﬂourish in
herbowel aiding in
food digestion and
vitamln extraction
and

possibly staying off
diseases from
asthma to colon
cancer

“This diet that
Madonna is
following is very
senSIble,”

says David
Topping. chief food-
nutrition researcher
at

Australia’s
Commonwealth
Scientific and
Industrial Research
Organization in
Adelaide, who
studied gut biology
for 25 years.

“The bacteria that
live inside you are
fulfilling very
important
functions."

While scientlsts try
to understand the
ecology of the
bacteria and their
interactions with
diet and dlsease,
companies

are looking for ways
to profit

The health benefits
of gut germs have
spawned a global
market for products

that contaln friendly
bacteria, called
probiotics, in the
form of tablets or
supplements added
to foods

by companies
including Danone,
Nestle SA, and
Yakult Honsha Co.
The market for

products such as
Danone’s

Activia yoghuns
and Yakult’s

bacteria to a

others have been

Nishimura, who has
cooked for cancer
patients before
being

hired by Madonna,
serves quinoa and
other whole grains
as

staples, along with
vegetables and soy
sauce. she said in a
telephone interview
from New York. She
also tries to offer
seaweed every
second day --
usually sauteed or
boiled.

“We eat food

dietary approach.
known as
macrobiotic. She
doesn't recommend
meat, dairy and
coffee. An agent for
Madonna

didn’t respond to a
request for
comment.

Whole grains and
fiber act as both
food and fertilizer to
the bacteria in the
bowel, according to
Mark Morrison. a

NIH Production to ICAN_000781

studylng ways

to improve gut
function and health.

‘Terrific Interest’

There are 10 times
as many bacteria in
the human intestlnal
tract as there are
cells in the body. As
coordinator of the
Human MIcrobiome
Project, Lita Proctor
is helping to
organize
collaboration from
hundreds of
scientists around
the world

trying to map and
study microbial
communities living
on the skin,

in the mouth and
bowel, and in other
parts of the body
“lt's extremely
heartenlng and
healthy to have so
much

attention now paid
to the diet," says
Proctor, who works
at the

National Human
Genome Institute in
Bethesda,
Maryland

Even so, Proctor
says the research is
still in its infancy,
and products based

NIH Production to ICAN_000782

on partial
understanding may
not deliver what
they promise.
“That‘s not holding
up the industry,"
she says. “It's a
very ﬂuid, ill-defined
area, but with a lot
of terrific

interest"

Flowers and Weeds

The term probiotic
IS vague and there’s
no accepted
deflnition for it.
Measuring results
may be even more
of a grey

area and some
supplements are
destroyed by
stomach acid
before

entering the gut,
according to
Proctor.

Nishimura relies on
fermented foods
such as miso, soy
sauce

and tempeh to play
the role of
problotics and says
the benefits

of her dlet can be
quickly noticed

“l feel better than I
did 20 years ago,”
Madonna wrote in
a preface to the
cookbook her chef
had published in
2010. “I am

very grateful to you
for this"

The garden analogy
is helpful when it
oomes to describing
the complex
ecology of the
bacteria living on
humans, says Julie
Segre, the lead
investigator working
on the skin
microbiome at

the National Human
Genome Research
Institute.

“There are some
flowers that make it
easier for other
ﬂowers to grow in
the same soil,"
Segre says. The
most

important thing is to
keep out the
invasive weeds, she
says.

‘Transpoosmns’

When the weeds
take over,
Australian
gastroenterologist
Thomas Borody has
a radical approach
to reestablishing the
balance of intestinal
ﬂora in his patients:
he transplants

fecal germs from
disease-free
individuals directly
into the

upper reach of the
colon. in a pouch

NIH Production to ICAN_000783

NIH Production to ICAN_000784

known as the
cecum.

His Sydney clinic
has done 1.800 of
the procedures,
which

he jokingly dubs
“transpoosions,”
over 25 years.
Borody, 62,

says the treatment
has helped patients
with ailments
ranging

from autism to
pseudomembranou
s colitis, a resilient
infection

that causes
abdominal pain,
loose bowel
movements and
fever.

“The next day their
diarrhea stops “ the
doctor says

After the procedure,
he asks patients to
avoid treatments
that

may damage their
gut flora. Three
studies presented
at the

American College
of
Gastroenterology's
meeting in October
indicate fecal
transplants can help
with bouts of
diarrhea
associated with the
bacterium
Clostridlum difficiie

NIH Production to ICAN_000785

When Weeds Take
Over

Keeping inner bugs
healthy is cruelal
because otherwise
they risk taking over
more than the
garden. If Intestinal
bacteria aren't able
to survive on the
food their host
consumes,

the germs will try to
feed on what they
can find -- “mucus
as

well as anything
else," according to
CSlRO’s Topping.
That may

lead to
inflammatory bowel
disease, a painful
condition that can
evolve into colon
cancer, he says
Staying off disease
is one reason
people have turned
to

Nishimura’s cooking
in the past. The
chef, who prepared
meals

for cancer patients
in Boston, says the
diet helps with
oonstlpation,
menstrual pain and
body odor. When
she ﬁrst

changed the way
she ate, Nishimura
says she also found
that her

NIH Production to ICAN_000786

improved

‘So Fresh'

Typically, Nishimura
tailors her meals
each day to suit the
way her employer
feels, she says,
adding that
Madonna prefers
the chef herself to
shop for
ingredients. Popular
dishes Include
seaweed in miso
soup: hijiki -- a type
of brown seaweed -
served with carrots
and onions and
seasoned with soy
sauce: and

cooked oats for
breakfast,
Nishimura sayst
Whole grains
demand harder

nutrients from food

the insoluble fiber

Madonna and
others making
similar diet choices
may not know
they’re pushing the
science frontier.
They mayJust feel
better.

“When you cut out
animal products,
white sugar and
coffee

for 10 days you
start to feel the
difference,"
Nishimura said.
“When I first began

NIH Production to ICAN_000788

this dlet, I
remember how my
head became
clearer. I woke up
earlier and felt so
fresh in the morning
that

I didn't want to stay
in bed.”

isn't lacking in
stamina. Her world

ends next March,
includes 75
concerts in Europe
and North America

Hi Dr. Fauei:

I have been a long time admirer of you in the ﬁeld of modern medicine. This question I have relates to the current
Coionayirus circulating around the world. For ntany years I have informed people that the ways a virus can be
passed from person to person Isn't always by a sncczc, cough or by touching someones lace With their hands. Has
anyone in your medical commumry though: that if someone were smoking and was an infected person that once they
expel the smoke particles into the airthnt those micro smoke panicles may contain viruses that were in the
respiratory system of an infected person. Everyone I mention this to don‘t believe that this is possible. What are your
thoughts on this mallet? lrsu why hasn’t the medical omnrnunity wanted the publit. about this possibility asl stay
away from all establishments that allow smoking on their premises.

Thank you,

Daniel Gagtinn

Subject: Interview Request from China

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I’m Faye Li, journalist from the Portrait, a national magazine in China. My beat is science and technology.
Since the outbreak ofthe 2019 novel coronavirus (COViD-19) in China, I’m covering feature stories about
the outbreak, hoping to explain to readers what it is, especially since the virus is evolving daily at an
unexpected high speed, and in so many confusing ways.

Now in China we are getting conflicting information about the new virus and thus become confused
about it. For example, we are seeing more and more cases that a patient Wlth negative test results for 2
non-continuous days, stlll infected with the virus and tested positive afterwards It makes the treatment
really difficult because it seems hard to determine whether the patient is fully cured or not. Since you
are an experienced immunologist, I’m wondering ifyou could share your insights with the Chinese
readers and take an interview. The Interview could be via phone or email, whichever works fine for you.

NIH Production to ICAN_000799 "MW?

If possible, I'd love to send you the questions before we talk. Since we have time difference, I might not
be available during the early afternoon (your time) but I could make it in the morning, noon and maybe
late in the afternoon and evening (yourtime).

I’m sorry for bothering you on this subject, but we face severe difficulty in understanding this new virus
and taking measures properly. We have quite limited sources and perspectives for understanding this
new virus, However, as a science reporter, I believe in a crisis of public health, the information isthe key
for the public‘ They should have the opportunity to hear more perspectives from different specialists.
Since you are experienced in fighting against so many viruses, especially SARS, I believe your opinions
will be inspiring to the readers,

It would be of great help and great honorfor us to invite you for an interview. A phone call interview
would be preferred but if time doesn’t work for you, is it possible for you to reply via email? I'll list all
the questions in detail.

I could be reached by (5)051 or 00(5) I'm looking forward to your reply.
Best wishes,

Faye

Hi. Kim A

I spoke to Dr, Jacobs directly, He said that Dr, Michael Lockshin is a good friend/fellow
Cornell graduate (Dr. Jacobs also noted he went to Cornell) and gave him Dr. Fauci's
number.

Dr. Jacobs and Dr. AlexanderTarakhovsky, a virologist at The Rockefeller Institute, would
like to speak to Dr. Fauci about the coronavirus. They have a theorythat there may be
yeast involved because it is sticky and perhaps it came rrern the Chinese government.
They want to share their ideas and perhaps start a U.S. government effort ”similar to The
Manhattan Project." They do not want funding.

I thanked Dr. Jacobs for sharing his ideas and stated that I would pass along the message.
Should Dr. Fauci wish to speak to them, Dr. Jacobs can be reached at the number below
and Dr. Tarakhovsky can be reached at 00(6)

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Dear Dr. Fauci: lam an ex-alumni from the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the NIH. I am sorry to
bother but I wanted to notifythe CoronavirusTaskforce about potential blood shortages if blood
centers get blood drive cancellations due to the fear in the public.

We are starting to see this locally and my concern IS that other blood centers In the country are facing
the same issue.

I tried to contact the office ofthe vice president, and all i could do was to send an email, which might
get lost among thousands.

I am hoping you see this and perhaps bring this to the table. Blood centers use updated federal
information when educating donors, staff and hospitals but the current fear istriggering blood drive
cancellations. This might be experienced nationally and will impact the national blood inventory.

Thank you

Dear Dr. Fauci,

First let me say we are very grateful to everyone at NIH for working to contain the coronavirus,
especially your team at the NIAID, Vour interviews are articulate and informative -they give Americans
some comfort and some concrete ways to think about protecting themselves and what to expect. It
must be a stressful time and we want you to know that we have confidence in our NIH and CDC to
contain it and to help stave it off globally as well,

On a happier note, I wanted to reach out and THANK YOU for all you do for our Down Syndrome
research through the transformative trans-NIH INCLUDE program. It is making a HUGE difference!!

To this end, I am writing today in hopes you will be able to join us on Wednesday. May 20th for our
AcceptAbility Gala at my head table. Attached is oursave the date for the event. We are excited to have
Caroline Cardenas as our 2020 Ambassador, Rep Pete Stauber as our keynote ( 00(6)

We do understand that attendance cannot be considered if the coronavirus situation worsens. However,
if things are looking much better (touch wood) we would be deeply honored if you and ourfriends from

NIAID could attend. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

All the Best, Michelle and family

Dear Dr. Fauct

Dr. Miriam Kelly formerly of NIH referred me to you. I am on the board of directors and planning
committee of the Applied Superconductivity Conference that is planned to be held in Tampa, Florida the
last week of July. Over 50% of our expected 1500 attendees are from outside the continental US. Our
planning committee appears to have three options

1 Hold the conference on the original dates

2 Postpone the conference a few months

3 Cancel the conference

It would be most helpful to decision process if you can give us a prediction (anonymously of course) of
how the effects of the virus will pan out.

I look forward to your reply.

Dear Ms. Angel:

The severe complication of coronavirus are heavilyskewed towards the elderly and those
with underlying conditions (Heart disease, Chronic lung disease, kidney disease, diabetes,
etc.) Most of the oneumonias are pure viral pneumonia and so this vaccination will not help
that. However, on the chance that you have a pure viral pneumonia that gets secondarily
complicated by a bacterial pneumonia lpneumococcal) the vaccine would be beneficial. If
you are 65 years of age or older, you should get the pneumonvax23 vaccine anyway
regardless of the risk of coronavirus infection.

Subject: A humble request for your wisdom

Good evening!

I know you must be completely busy and inundated with people wanting yourtime. I apologize that l
have nothing to offer in return and completely understand if you don't have time to answer. I called
the CDC but they were totally unhelpful. l have a question that makes sense to me and lwas hoping

you could answer and the answer might help a lot of people.

I understand that over time l, and everyone else, will very likely get comm-19 and that most people
won't even realize it because it will be minor. l get that, so this is not a panicked question.

I also understand that while most cases will not be severe. the bad cases are complicated by
pneumonla,

So my question is: If someone has been vaccinated against pneumonia, will that offer any protection
in the event that they do contract COVID-lB and perhaps provide some barrier against the worst
effects?

Thank you for yourtime if you have read this and I apologize ifthis is just another in a long line of
ignorant questions, but ‘lt made sense in my brain so I thought I would at least ask.

Be well, be happy, and may life be kind and generous to you, those you love, and those who love
you!

sincerely,

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I apologize in advance for this email. lam sure you are too busy these days to answer
coronavirus questions from the general public. However, you are the only individual I know of
who can be trusted to speak intelligently about the pandemic.

I know there is no preventive vaccine or cure, and there probably won't be for quite some time-
-despite what our ersatz President says. But there is something I don't understand. Since the
coronavirus causes pneumonia, wouldn't it be a good idea to vaccinate more ofthe general
population with Pneumovax 23 or Prevnar 13? That certainly wouldn't prevent people from
catching coronavirus, but perhaps the resulting penumonia onsets might be a little

weaker/5.0....ived?—

Dear Doctor Fauci,

I am writing to you as a member of the SPEAC project which CEPI has funded to assist with the
evaluation of the safety of vaccines in their portfolio. As part of this effort, we are assisting
with developing preclinical and clinical testing criteria to evaluate the risk of enhanced disease
following vaccination with COVIDA19 vaccine candidates, As you know, this had been an issue
with some prior SARS vaccine candidates.

We are convening a two day virtual meeting of experts via video conference next week on
March 12 and 13 between 8am and 1 pm Eastern time each day. Participants in the meeting
are shown in the attached agenda but include Paul Henri Lambert from Geneva and Barney
Graham from NIH. The meeting will actively involve the participants on the agenda the first day

NIH Production to ICAN_000834 N'Mum‘

and on the second day the meeting will be open for several peer reviewers including Stanley
Plotkin and Andy Pollard to review and comment on possible small and NH? animal models as
well as appropriate immunologic testing to be done in early phase one trials.

I am wanted to make you aware of the meeting so that you could attend all or part as an
observer if you wish but also to invite you to consider joining on day two as one ofour formal
peer rewewers. The goal of the meeting would be to share recommendations with CEPI
COVID-19 developers as well as other interested parties.

Any comments you have on the agenda or draft questions for consideration would be greatly
appreciated.

Ilook forward to hearing back from you.

Hello, Dr. Fauci,

My name is Donna Prosser, and I am the Chief Clinical Officer at the Patient Safety Movement
Foundation. We are planningto host a webinar on Friday, March 6 at 8:00am PST to update our network
on the coronavirus outbreak. Our network consists of 4,710 healthcare organizations across 46
countries, as well as patients, families, individual clinicians, and technology companies across the globe,
who partner with us to achieve our goal of eliminating deaths from medical errors

During Friday's webinar, we plan to focus on how to keep patients safe from harm during this outbreak,
and would love to have someone with your expertise join the call for a brief comment. Would you by
any chance be available and willing to speak with our network sometime between 8»9am PST? We
would be grateful for any amount of time that you could spare during that hour.

Thank you for your consideration!

Subject: How to put COVID719 statistics in perspective

Today (March 3], CNN featured a discussion with NY Gov. Cuomo regarding a new COVID-19 case in NY
City. He happened to note that there are currently about 15,000 patients in NY hospitals with the flu.
Although multiple government agencies, scientists and health experts keep reminding us that there are
far more cases, hospitalizations and deaths each year from influenza than this coronavirus, it strikes me
that a more effective, more visual and less fear-producing wav of presenting this information would be
to present the current number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths from EACH of these diseases side by
side. If the number of flu cases, hospitalizations and/or deaths isn’t available on a daily basis, we could
use extrapolations based on known rates. Ithink this would certainly go a long way to putting the
relative risks of these diseases in clearer focus.

Subject: idea to help with Coronavlrus infection

Dr. Fauci,
| first want to thank you for your service and efforts in combating this international health problem.

I’m neither a physician or a scientist so please accept my apology if my idea is SlmpllSth or isn’t feasible.
But I was thinking about some of the information presented on why it seems to be less prevalent in
children. One theory l5 that they are exposed to so many other coronavirus’s that they experience cross—
protection. So I was wondering if anyone had investigated the idea to flood adults with other, less lethal,
coronavirus’s as a way to develop some level of immunity? Ideally coronavirus’s that are a match to
what children would be exposed to is what I‘m suggesting here. l wouldn‘t expect that this will totally
protect an adult but it might reduce the severity of the illness if an adult becomes ill and help while a
vaccine and treatments are launched.

Thank you for considering this idea.

Best,
Jeff

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you for youruseful editorial published in NEJM last week, it helps confirming that the situation
does not need to be as glim as the panic that most people are experiencing.

I am writing an editorial and hoping to submit it to The Lancet soon. Differently from NIH/US
Government institutes, l have more room for reﬂection in my viewpoint.

For that reason, I was wondering ifl can have a call with you to get your opinion/advice on the direction
of my editoriaL I know how busy you are and I can understand if you do not have the time, but if by
chance you are willing to have this call, I’ll be happy to share my editoriai’s draft first.

As a background, I am an EiS graduate (class of 2009), and trained by Robert T. Chen.

Since the elderly's response to pulmonary coronavirus infection may be impaired, especially in those with a chronic

rationale in early coronavirus infection to try to minimize serious pneumonia were such inhalation shown to be

Subject: Possible treatment of COVlD-19 pneumonia

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Nitric Oxide (N0) has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of inﬂuenza virus-
induced pneumonia in mouse model (Zablockiene et al., 2012).

Zablockiene B, Ambrozaitis A, Kacergius T, Gravenstein S. Implication of nitric
oxide in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection. Biologija 2012; 58(1): 15-25.

NO overproduction in influenza virus pneumonia results from a sustained stimulation of
inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) (Akaike et al., 1996).

Maeda Pathogenesis of influenza virus-Induced pneumonia: Involvement of
both n ric oxide and oxygen radicals. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Mar 19;
93(6):2448-53.

 

NO overproduction in influenza virus-induced pneumonia can generate highly reactive
oxygen species, peroxynitrite, via radical coupling reaction of NO with superoxide

NIH Production to ICAN_000867 "mum”

[resulting from inﬂuenza Virus-induced increased levels of xanthine oxidase (X0)
(Maeda and Akaike, 1998).

Maeda H, A—kaike T. Nitric oxide and oxygen radicals in infection inflammation,
and cancer. Biochemistry (Mose). 1998 Jul; 63(7): 854-65

Peroxynitrite causes oxidative tissue injury through potent oxidation and nitration
reactions of various biomolecules (Akaike and Maeda, 2000).

Akaike T, Maeda H. Nitric oxide and virus infection. Immunology. 2000 Nov;
101(3):300-8.

The crucial role of NO in influenza virus-induced
pneumonia was demonstrated on iNOS gene knockout
mice: at inocula sufficient to cause consolidating
pneumonia and death in the wild—type control mice, iNOS
gene deficient mice survived with little histopathologic
evidence of pneumonia (Karupiah et al., 1998).

Karupiah G, Chen JH, Mahalingam 5, Nathan CF, MacMicking JD. Rapid interferon
gamma-dependent clearance of inﬂuenza A virus and protection from

consolidating pneumonitis in nitric oxide synthase 2-deficient mice. J Exp Med.
1998 Oct 19; 188(8):1541-6.

Both influenza and coronaviruses could have the same pathogenetic mechanism
of inducing pneumonia, namely harmful overproduction NO.

Iwould like to present you my innovative idea: Suppressing NO overproduction in
COVlD-19 complicated to pneumonia with Methylene Blue (MB)

Arguments pro:

MB is known as a guanylatetguanylyl cyclase inhibitor but it is mainly a NOS inhibitor
(nNOS and iNOS).

MB is an inhibitor of superoxide generation by xanthine oxidase and NADH/NADPH
oxidases.

MB is a small molecule capable to penetrate in tissues and cells

MB was administered intravenously in patients with refractory septic shock and
Hepatopulmonary Syndrome of advanced liver cirrhosis.

MB administered intravenously will definitively reach the cells where N08 is induced by
COVlD-19 complicated by pneumonia both in animals and humans:

NIH Production to ICAN_000868

-Airway epithelium (including alveolar epithelial cells);
-Alveolar macrophages;
Capillary/vascular endothellum (endothelial cells)
MB is an inexpensive medication.
MB is non-toxic molecule in humans

There are only a few cases of MB toxicity published in the literature. These cases
occurred in very peculiar situations:

Hemolytic anemia in patients with GG-PD deficiency

Severe neuropathology after intrathecal administration of MB
Eye injury after topical use of MB

Tissue necrosis due to the extravasation of injected MB
Jejunal atresia following intra-amniotic MB

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI's) interact with MB, causing a serious adverse
reaction consistent with serotonin syndrome,

Very truly yours,

Subject: Dr. Fauci.| have a possible reason children are immune to the coronavirus. Please read

Hello Dr. Fauci, I am a- pharmacist from Ontario, Canada. I wasjust reading an article that stated
covid-l9 cases in children undernine v.0. are almost non—existant. I wondered why, and then an answer
dawned on me. They have an immunity because one of the childhood vaccines all children get is giving
them cross immunity to coronavirus as well. A study should be done immediately to see which one gives
cross immunity, if indeed that is the reason for their seeming immunity to this virus. The immunity must
wear off over time which is why adults and seniors seem to lack prior immunity and get sick. This
hypothesis is certainly worth investigating. If this is what is happening, maybe millions oflives could be
saved by a simple booster of an existing vaccine. Please let me know your thoughts on this matter.
Thanks for your time. Rob

Folks, we're doing a story that focuses in part on the administration's conference call from last Thursday
noon about a decision to send out more CDC coronavirus assays despite the fact that they had become
contaminated and compromised. We understand that Dr. Fauci was one of four federal doctors (the
others being Drs. Hahn, Shuren and Shah) who strongly recommended the assays not be sent out.

I want to give Dr. Fauci a chance, on or off the record, to comment on the story please.

Subject: Re: Q

This is the descriptive portion of my column. I don’t want to over or understate:

America is entering a disturbing new stage in the coronavirus
outbreak. There has been community spread in at least one and likely two
locations in Washington State. And it appears the Virus was being
transmitted for at least a few weeks before current cases were recognized.
So we can expect dozens or hundreds of cases in those locations unless
contact tracing is especially efﬁcient.

That means the disease is loose and easily transmitted.

The crucial issue now is the real mortality rate, which remains
uncertain. The stated mortality is 2 percent. American experts are hoping
the rate turns out to be considerably lower. But the math remains troubling
in any case. If only 5 percent of the population eventually gets infected
(which is on the low side of some estimates) and the mortality rate is 1
percent, there still would be a few hundred thousand deaths.

NIH Production to ICAN_000881 ”me

At this stage, the main tool that public health experts have is social
distancing — the attempt to keep as many people as possible in affected
areas out of sneezing distance from one another. This means measures such
as closing schools, cancelling events in theaters and stadiums and
encouraging employees to telework. States and localities ultimately make
such decisions rather than the federal government. But according to some
health experts I consulted, Washington State should be taking such
measures right now. The effectiveness of social distancing is limited when
action comes too late or ends too early.

The goal of such policies is to keep the R0 (reproduction ratio) as low
as possible. When people are in close proximity, a single infected person
can spread the disease to several others, boosting the R0 of the disease as
high as 2 to 3 and causing an exponential increase in cases. If the R0 is less
than one, the epidemic will gradually decline and stop on its own, with or
without a vaccine.

Avaccine, however, would be tremendously helpful. There are at least
ten vaccine development projects underway. But the one furthest along at
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is still about six weeks away from
starting the process of a phase 1 trial in human volunteers that will
take 3 to 4 months to complete and to show that the vaccine safe
and produces speciﬁc antibodies. A phase 2 trial will follow and
will take at least 6 to 8 months to determine if the vaccine is
efﬁcacious in people at risk for infection. Then production would
need to be scaled up by a willing pharmaceutical company to deal with a
global crisis. All this in total will take at least a year — assuming there are
no unpredicted scientiﬁc obstacles in the way.

Is the overall strategy for social distancing just to keep the percentage of Americans who
get the disease low until a vaccine is available? This seems much harder to do in a free

such decisions?

Thanks for the note. We are clearly getting ”community spread“ in at least
one and likely two non-contiguous locations. It was likely spreading in
Washington State for at least a few weeks before the current cases were
recogniled, which means we can expect dozens and dozens of cases (or
more) in that location unless we are vey lucky and/or the contact tracing is
highly efficient. The precise mortality rate is still uncertain. The stated

NIH Production to ICAN_000883 ""wm‘m

mortality is 2%; however. even if it is half that (1%) and only 5% of the
population get infected, you are correct in that we can have a few hundred
thousand deaths. The really critical issue is what the mortality rate actually
turns out to be. I am hoping for a considerably lower mortality rate, but that
might be wishful thinking, Whatever it turns out to be, the major tools that
we have are public health measures, particularly social distancing. which we
have to start doing right now in Washington State and thinking about in other
locations. That is really the major weapon that we have. Even though we go
into phase 1 with one candidate vaccien in about 6 weeks, vaccine is out of
the question for at least a year or more if you want to make sure that you
have an effective vaccine, i.e. some efficacy data before massive deployment.

We are meeting with pharmaceutical executive today and i will bring up the
issue of whatthe fastest possible timeline would be to have a deployable
vaccine.

Tony,

I was with Francis yesterday, and the news seemed pretty sobering. It seems
like the virus is out in the general population in the Pacific Northwest and
Silicon Valley. A pandemic now appears likely. Francis gave me a guesstimate
that 5 to 20 percent of the US population may end up infected. Depending on
the mortality rate, this could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Not for attribution in any way, is this a fair summary? How and when will we
know ifthe disease is on this track? Do we have any better info on mortality
yet?

And is there any news on the vaccine front? As I understand it, we are not
even to Phase 1 trials on anything. If a vaccine is promising, are well talking
about late Fall as the earliest possibility? And are there any substantive
measures that could be taken to make sure pharma steps up to produce a
vaccine on a massive scale once we have It?

I’m not sure Americans have been adequately prepared for this possibility.
That is partly a political problem (in my View). But what needs to happen

soon to get people prepared?

Hope you are holding up well under all of this and taking care ofyourself.

Are you using the same “DNA platform" you showed us in the Zika story to build a

and the world, and is a proxy for the integrity of science and medicine.

According to one house member, the following:

Garamendi told MSNBC‘s Hallie Jackson that Anthony Fauci was
scheduled to do all ﬁve major Sunday talk shows, but says Fauci
canceled the appearances after Vice President Pence took over the
administration's response to the disease.

Trump on Wednesday named Pence as the official overseeing the
government‘s response.

"i can repeat what he said, he said, 'I was not muzzled. However, I
was to go on the Sunday talk shows five of them. The vice
president's ofﬁce then took over the control of this situation, and told
me to stand down, not to do those shows!" Garamendi said, quoting
Fauci.

We cannot mince words about this or have nuances. If you were told not to appear
on Sunday talk shows, then a reasonable person would have to assume your speech
indeed is being controlled. Whether you call it “muzzled" or censored is a matter of
semantics. Is it factual that you were told/asked not to appear on these shows as had
been scheduled?

Subject: personal Immune baseline and its impact an infection and vaccine responses
Dear Dr. Fauci.

Hope you are doing well despite the rapidly evolving situation with COVlD-19.

Iwanted to send you a paper we just published last week that you might find relevant— please find
attached and a NIAID piece below.

httDs://www.niaid.nih .eov/news-events/in1mune-svstem-status-predicts-future-responses

NIH Production to ICAN_000899 N'Mmm

This paper asks the question of why do individuals mount variable immune responses to vaccines,
infections, and diseases, This extends from our earlier work on baseline predictors of inﬂuenza
vaccination responses that you highlighted as a NIAID Advance in 2014, A key message is that genetics is
often unlikely the answer, but the status of the immune system before the perturbation may offer clues
- here we identiﬁed such an immune cell circuit involving pDCs-Type I IFNs prior to perturbation in
humans and found that its status can predict vaccination and lupus disease actIVIties and is temporally
stable within individuals for months,

 

Many thanks!

Best wishes,
John.

Subject: Outreach from STAT

Tony,

I know you're swamped but l'm wondering if we could arrange for you this week to take questions from
our readers about coronavirus. All of our coronavirus coverage is in front of STAT‘s paywall and we‘d see
your contribution as an enormous public serVice.

We would solicit questions for a "live chat" from readers -» and you could pick and choose which ones
you want to answer -- and write most of them in advance.

Among other leading figures, we‘ve done this format twice with Nobel winners and it's quite popular.
httDs://www.statnews.com/events/srat-live»chat-chat-with-a-ZO19-nobel-winnine-scientist/

With Helen Branswell, Sharon Begley, Matt Herper, and our whole team, we pride ourselves on covering
the coronavirus in the most authoritative and fair-minded wav. We‘ve developed a tremendous

audience for this coverage. httgs:Z[www.statnews.comztaglcoronavirusL

Our readers are fairly sophisticated on health and medicine, and we're looking to focus on the health
aspects, not the White House politics.

NIH Production to ICAN_000902 "'Hm‘m

In addition, I’d be grateful if you'd consider writing another First Opinion for us, maybe on lessons
you've learned regarding other outbreaks and hewthat might be relevant with coronavirus -- or
whatever you'd like.

Your voice of course is very important and authoritative and we'd be grateful to have it again in STAT‘

All best,

Last February, I moved to Business Roundtable, which represents CEOs of large U.S. companies. Josh is
the BRTCEO, and it's been great to work with him again.

We wanted to check with you on something quickly. Traditionally, BRT has not weighed in on global
health security policy, but COVID-lB has served as a reminder that global companies need to be strong
advocates for global public health and security. If you had your choice, what would you want to see

our companies advocating for, specifically?

No worries at all if you don't have time to respond. We fullyappreciate how important yourtime is.

Subject: ARE therapy in Covid-19 infection

Thank you for responding to my email yesterday about the possibility of ARB therapy
in treatment of coronavirus infection. I realize that your research is ongoing. Would you
anticipate, however, that the ARB with the most potential role in preventing virus
attachment would be the one that has the greatest affinity for the AT2 receptor? Am i
correct that losartan is the ARB with the lower receptor (AT1 vs AT2) selectivity and
might logically be the most promising ARB to investigate? Thanks. Dr Thomas Leopold

Dear Dr Fauci,

I heard this idea on a radio interview with Laurie Garrett this morning 7 how about
getting your committee (or one of the government health agencies) to produce a
series of short YouTube videos on how to combat the coronavirus: such things as
proper handwashing technique, when to wear a mask, how to ride the subway
safely, etc, etc. I think this would be an excellent way to reach the public in the
digital age (provided that Mike Pence doesn’t try to turn them into campaign ads
for Donald Trump), and I strongly urge you to give the strategy serious
consideration. I know I would watch them and I’m sure millions of other people
would too.

consideration if some ”community level action" may be appropriate, with a move towards a

appears to at least in part attach through cell membrane angiotensin H type 1 receptors. Is the lower
incidence of the disease in children possibly due to this cohort having a higher proportion of angiotensin

Dear Dr. Fauci,

My name is Emily Sanchez and I am an economist at the American Chemistry Council. I am reaching out
to you in my capacity as President of the National Economists Club (NEC), which is an organization of
over 1000 government and private sector economists based in DC. The NEC holds weekly luncheon
events which feature notable experts and economists in Washington.

Increasingly, economists are being asked to assess the economic impacts around the incidence and
spread of the corona virus as well as the impact of reduced economic activity due to behavioral changes
(eg. people not leaving their homes to work or shop, supply chain disruptions, etc). As economists are
tasked in assessments, scenario planning and communicatingtheirestimates, accuracy around their
assumptions and understanding ofthe corona virus and Covid-19 is imperative. We are incredibly
appreciate ofthe important work and research that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases provides and we are wondering if you would be willing to speak at one of our luncheons about
Covid-19 and the latest developments.

NIH Production to ICAN_000916 "WWI

Do you think you might have time in your schedule to speak to the National Economist Club this
month? We would love to have you speak duringthe week of March 16-20.

Our luncheons typically take place at the Chinatown Garden Restaurant, 618 H St. NW, with lunch at
noon and your presentation from 12:30 pm, til 1:30 pm. Talks are normally on the record and open to
the press. unless you request otherwise.

Thank you for your consideration

Hi Dr. Fauci,

You've kindly allowed me to engage you, and I'll take advantage ofthat kindness.

The news media is reporting that the White House has mun/ed you. Is that true? Before entering the

and understand the idea of coordinated messaging. (Plus, due to my media background, Boeing used me

to help executives prepare for media engagements on challenging topics.) However, if it’s true that you
are muzzled, then i will initiate a "campaign” with my congressional representatives and the media to

stop that action. I (b) (6)
However, before I initiate such a campaign, will my actions possibly cause you harm? I recognize that
you may have backchannels that I may disrupt by engaging.

As i related previously, I trust you since you focus on facts and data, you provide context for the
information that you share, and you avoid emotion in your engagements. Ithinkthat residents of the US
(and, frankly the world) need your insights regarding COVID-19. Plus, you’re one of the world leaders

Please let me know if I should stay silent or become noisy.

Dear Tony,

I wanted to share a very recent and surprising result we’ve obtained on the
mechanism of antibody protection for anti~vira| antibodies. We’ve previously shown
that bNAbs to flu and HIV require FcR engagement fortheir in vivo potency.
Enhancing activating FcR engagement increases the potency of these antibodies by
an order of magnitude, on average, and thus are significant contributors to anti-viral
protection.

Subject: Navel Treatment for Reducing Symptoms Associated with Coronavirus (COVID—19)- ”Nonv
Confidential”

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Sen—Jam Pharmaceutical has a product underdevelopment to reduce the symptoms associated with
Upper Respiratory Infection (URI). We believe it could provide relief to a large number of people during
the COVlD-19 pandemic. Our product SJP-OOZ is a combination of an NSAID and a nonesedating
antihistamine and does not include a decongestant. Removing the decongestant makes our product
ideal for treating the symptoms associated with COVlD-19 in patients with cardiac conditions who
cannot tolerate taking a decongestant.

What makes our product novel is that it can be administered early in the treatment phase, thereby
reducing the excessive accumulation of inflammation, which typically results in head congestion,
pulmonary congestion, coughing, & sneezing. Our experience has shown that at the lst signs of
experiencing symptoms of URI an individual's symptoms can be drastically reduced aftertaking our

NIH Production to ICAN_000927 ”mum“

product twice a day for 3 days, The dramatic reduction in inflammation has the potential to reduce the
spreading of the virus by means of cough, sneezing, and spreading of germs through contact. Currently,
when individuals experience the start ofa URl, there is little effective intervention available to change
the course ofthe infections individuals delay administering pharmaceutical agents, until their
congestion becomes intolerable and excessive,

Attached is a copy ofour early research and a copy ofour non-provisional patent. | share this
information with the hope of providing some background for an immediately accessible, safe treatment,
alternative to slow the pace and impact of the pandemic.

Let me now if we can be of any additional help?

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Those of us who seek factual, scientificallyrbased information to the highest degree that it is possible to
obtain it will remain hungry and on the alert for whatever complete, up-to-the-moment information
that you may have as humanity proceeds deeper intothe Cowd»19 potential pandemic. We have trusted
you through several previous epidemics to provide such information. Therefore, I know I‘m not alone in
being appalled and frightened by President Trump wanting you to issue information about the current
crises only after it has been cleared by his administration, In his office as President. Donald Trump may
be defacto, Commander-in Chief. There is nothing about his office that confers Expert-in-Chief on him,
and what he chooses to say or not say about Covid-19 and its spread should not be treated by the media
or anyone as information that is trustworthy for being factual and scientiﬁcallyebased information to
the highest degree lhat ii is possible to obtain,

I hope that you will find it in yourself and in the mission of your office to publicly assure the American
public in no uncertain terms that you will not be censored, and that you will honor the public's trust to
continue to provide real. research-based information about the frightening health nightmare that all
humans are facing in a way that distinguishes us from China's government in its disgraceful and
destructive efforts to muzzle those experts who might be able to save lives by merely speaking truth to a
population whose health depends on having factebased, totally unimassaged knowledge as soon as it is
available.

Dear Dr. Fauci:

I reviewed the publications about the last 2 coronavirus infections. Both MERS and SARS were severe,
short lived problems that have not recurred. One would expect Covir—19 to follow a similar path: infect
a wide group of susceptible people and then disappear, If that is so, anything that is more than six
months away may not be of value—remdisivir or a vaccine. Even if remdisivir works, it will take months
to produce sufficient amounts to treat this illness.

Has ribavirin been assessed for an ability to slow down the replication of this virus? We do not need to
eradicate the virus Just slowing down the rate of symptoms progression would allow time for the
immune system to mount a curative response.

Ribivirin is the only approved anti-viral that may have shown some clinical benefit against similar
coronavirus infections, but the reports are anecdotal and the benefit short term. It was only
administered to a few patients who were already on respirator support, and most still died. If their lungs
were already destroyed, eliminating the virus would not change the outcome. There were no studies of
treating mild illnesses before they progressed to needing respirator support. If the 50 year old
coronavirus patient described in the Lancet had been treated in first week of symptoms, before needing
respiratory support, he may have survived. On autopsy, most of his lung had been destroyed.

If ribavirin has even marginal benefit, decreasing hospitalization by 10% yields an enormous savings. I do
not have access to the data on this virus and the possible effects of the antivirals that have been
evaluated. However, ribavirin has any effect on viral proliferation, we can write and a randomized trial

Dear Dr. Fauci.

I'll not he at the CRO] this year (5) (6)
So 1 hope i may be able to ask
you a few questions as a concerned Citizen.

Will we learn:
Why there are new cases in the US ofunknnwn origin?

Could this virus infect carriers who do not present with symptoms or present in vArious levels tifvery mild
infection and ncvcr get identiﬁed as infected?

Could individuals host the vims differently due to genetics or ethnicity?

Is this virus consistently similar after multiple generation oris it capable or mutating?

Is there an ability to develop an antibody immunity through infection? Can one he reiiit'ccied7

Could the level ofintbctinn bc detcmi ilcd by the amount ofinoculanl?

Could we lcani the level ofinfeet ability ol‘tliis vims by testing eteryoni: in a given geographic area where
there is a deep outbreak‘.l We might also lemm about the pathogenesis in away that we cannot learn otherwise.

If this vims is so transmissible could we end up with almost everyone eventually being infected and present
with various levels of serious acute infection and death to indistinguishable cases or just carriers.l

With the clamplﬁlter on information from this administration, please tell us where we may find regular reports at
various levels ofcurrent science on what we learn about this \irus and vaccine progress, and where we may ask
questions? Ihope there is place for formal and informal community input into treatment, care and vaccine
development

Dear Vice President Pence,

We are thankful for your leadership of the White House Coronavirus Task Force in
gathering the latest information about the outbreak, working with doctors and
scientists to find solutions, and communicating with the general public regarding
the situation. We were blessed to meet with you back in August, 2019, when.
—had expressed a desire to meet
you. I have attached a picture from our meeting to help you remember. We pray
for you often.

NIH Production to ICAN_000969 "Wm“?

Since we are both physicians, we have been following the details of the COVID-
19 outbreak closely. My husband was researching the anti-viral drug remdesivir
this morning, and he came across some articles from Chinese studies that
indicated a very well-known drug called hydroxychloroguine (already widely
used for 70 years to treat malaria and rheumatological diseases) had very
potent activity against COVlD-19 infection and pneumonia. This was rather
surprising to us, but as we read about the study and the characteristics of
hydroxychloroguine we realized that this could be a very good drug to use for the
treatment of high-risk patients infected with COVlD-19, who might deteriorate
rapidly and progress to hospitalization and need for ICU care. Remdesivir also
seems like an excellent anti—viral drug, but it is given intravenously. and is
probably reserved for COV|D719 patients who are already entering into severe
respiratory distress in the hospital.

Hydroxychloroguine, on the other hand, is given orally, and is cheap and readily
available.

Low closes (6.5 mg / kg) have been effective in the management of Systemic
Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. 200 mg tablets are usually
prescribed twice a day with meals; dosage can be increased up to the
recommended 6.5 mg/kg if the patient tolerates the lower dose. We wondered if
the low dose hydroxychlorguine would be able to be studied quickly in various
COVlD-19 patients, especially those who are older and / or with medical
conditions that put them at higher risk for pneumonia and complications
(cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes,
etc.). In addition, hydroxychloroguine may even be a useful drug to prevent the
development of pneumonia in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

Because hydroxychloroguine in an older drug that is generic, current
pharmaceutical companies have no incentive to do studies or research on its
effectiveness for any new medical conditions. Therefore the federal
government would most likelv have to construct and fund the studies. Perhaps
Dr. Fauci has already considered this kind of study with hydroxychloroquine.

We understand that vaccines are already being studied, and Israel is working on
an oral (pill) vaccine, Vaccines take time to go through testing and trials, which is
why we are suggesting to you that studies be done on hydroxychloroquine, a
readily-available oral drug that could "bridge the gap” to provide some potential

treatment and mitigation of the COVID-19 infections while vaccines are being
developed and mass produced.

We have attached several articles, which are electronic publications made

available in advance (Feb. 4th & Feb 19th, 2020) of the printed journal
publications. We will send a copy of this email to Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfielcl, and Dr.
Azar.

A PPE device, tested and proven at Public Health England Porton Down (PHE), based on innovative
technology could be ready to go into production within 20 weeks. it sterilises all airborne pathogens as
air is inhaled by the wearer. See wwwtmedivimmunecom and in particularthe published report onthe
tests, by clicking on the report under ”The Science" The device is due to undergo further tests, at PHE

Health Services around the world are doing what they can to prepare for a significant increase in
infections from this highly transmissiblevirus and if those people in the Health Care Sectors are infected
the situation could become untenable.

The production of vaccines is under way but no one expects them to be available within the next 12 to
18 months. The Medielmmune ”ProtectivAir‘B", which has been under development for some years and
could be available within a few months, will give a fargreater level of protection than the current masks
and respirators and more importantly can remain in use in the future forother emerging airborne
pathogens— known, unknown or mutating.

Subject: A sharing on COVID ARDS research

Hi Dr. Fauci, I am a trained epidemiologist and expert in evidence based medicine. Particularly
in developing clinical practice guidelines and I teach REM and GRADE methods.

You have no idea how much I have admired you across the years, your intelligence and poise.
MayI ask how] may help you in this matter. this response, I am not talking about money. I wish
to help, volunteer.

I draw your attention to 2 attachments...

I) one is a one page I wrote to summarize a meta analysis my teamjust completed and seeking to
publish. It pertains to corticosteroids and ARDS. We are raising that this suggests indirect

evidence that we may be able to extrapolate to the COVID patient with severe illness, This
within the life threatening issue and emergency and no effective treatment. I share if this can

NIH Production to ICAN_000974 "'lwmm

help you as I know you are leading this and listened to you today with the president. [support
this president fully.

2) I share a paper published today. it on the other hand raises serious questions on the use of
corticosteroids in inﬂuenza associated ARDS, and one may argue this patient set, is the closest to
the COVID 19 patient.

My sense is that the accumulated evidence thus far is weak and argues against corticosteroids
l‘or example. this recently published multicenter retrospective cohort study in medical center
ICUs across Taiwan sought to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids in patients presenting
with inﬂuenza-associated ARDS (virology-proven ARDS and are on mechanical ventilation).
Researchers examined the impact of early corticosteroid treatment (2 200 mg hydrocortisone
equivalent dose within 3 days after ICU admission, determined by a sensitivity analysis) on
subsequent hospital mortality. The study revealed that of the 241 patients with inﬂuenza-
associated ARDS, those receivtng early corticosteroid had a signiﬁcantly higher hospital
mortality rate than those who did not get early corticosteroid [43.5% (37/85) vs, 192% (30/156),
p < 0.001], Early corticosteroid treatment was independently associated with increased hospital
mortality in overall patients [an adjusted OR of5.02 (95% CI 239-1054), p< 0.001] and in all
examined subgroups. Researchers found that a higher dose and earlier treatment was linked to
higher hospital mortality. Moreover. they found that earlier treatment was related to a
signiﬁcantly increased odds ofsuhsequenl bacteremia [an adjusted OR of2,37 (95% CI 1.01-
5.56)]. These results underscore the urgency for robust comparative randomized research given
this study is based on weaker observational evidence that is confounded by selection bias and
confounded. However this was a stronger study that used statistical adjustment and propensity
score matching. Thus this study suggests caution with corticosteroid and thus the importance for
caution by clinicians as to the potential harms ofccrticosteroids in this population. These results,
while based on weaker methodology, have revealed large estimates of effect, is the strongest
evidence to date on treatment for ARDS, and brings us closest to the COVID—19 ARDS patient.

Dear Mr. Fauci,

This may be way too presumptive of a note...
As an engineer I've always liked to understand the mechanics of how things work so I looked into
educating myself about the coronavirus and it's mechanics.—

— I've correlated a possible research route for your organization regarding the
prevention aspect.

A quick overlook on this strategy is the following:
Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that typically enter human cells when their glycoproteins bind
proteins on the cell surface. In the case of the Virus that causes SARS, that human protein is

angiotensin—converting enzyme 2 (ACEZ). At this time, scientists think the novel coronavirus is
similaI enough to SARS that its entry point is likely ACEZ as well.

Dear Tony.

Wonderful articles in JAMA and NEJM. So glad you are still heading NIAID- it is comforting that there
are experts of your caliber still in the room. And thrilled that the NIAID has done so much to develop
rapid timelines for DNA vaccines and that you highlighted that progress in the article, since people call me
the "Mother of DNA vaccines".

As a former NIAID Council member, I felt I should write to raise an issue that I am sensitized to as a
scientist who is ethnically Chinese while American:
Why in the JAMA article was it necessary to state that the ﬁrst travel»related case to the US was a
Chinese man (italics mine) who had visited Wuhan. Did his being Chinese either ethnically or by
citizenship affect anything biologically?

| ask because not only have many Asian people now encountered increased racism in public places
(due to fear that any Asian person is a source of COVlDr19). but now that the President is turning this
epidemic into additional fear-mongering about "borders" it seems all the more important that scientists do
not inadvertently add to "xenophobia" (even though non-white skin does not mean a person is foreign)
and do not seem to advance any political perspective

We met many years ago, Tony,

...at an event marking Shelly Wolff's 10 year anniversary at New England Medical Center. (I had the
distinction of being the first medical intern in that program who he reamed out.)

My question relates to travel restrictions. The current restrictions appear to be quite limited, but several
organizations, including Google, Amazon, and the HHMI have restricted, or cancelled, even domestic
meetings. As a result of the HHMI cancelation, my own program director indicated his intention to
cancel our upcoming Scientific Advisory meeting and, in the non-academic world, —
_ iwiici is ironic since iiieie
more coronavirus infections in my town of-Oregon than there are in all of New Vork).

In addition to announcing the new travel restrictions, could you also say something publicly about what
doesn't need to be restricted? In particular, is domestic travel OK, or not? Does the HHMI know
something the rest of us don’t?

Dear Dr Fauci,

Dr Murad sits on our BOD and has suggested that we contact you to help expedite a rapid testing of our
product on the COVlD-19 virus. 1 know you are probably overwhelmed but hope you might pass this
along or suggest a strategythat would be a Win-win for us all.

We have developed a non-alcohol based formulation that utilizes the nanomolecule nitric oxide (NO). as
you know, No is produced in our body and is ourfirst line of defense against microbes. We have
harnessed this in a patented formulation called nitric oxide releasing solution/gel (NORGS). We are
focused on the development of products for chronic sinusitis, diabetic foot wounds, warts and toenail
fungus.

However, internally & personally, we have been using NORGS as an extremely effective natural hand
sanitizer and nasal spray to protect ourselves from the common cold and flu for years.

There are strong independent published research that NO is antiviral against Corona viral species. We
hae data showing deﬁnite virucidal characteristics and moderate antiviral effects in host cells.

NIH Production to ICAN_000985 ”MW“

With the recent concern with COVlD-19, we felt we should try to rapidly test the hand rub and nasal
spray against the COVID-19 but need to collaborate with a laboratorythat could test this for us. Funding
collaborators are welcome too. as this was not in our budget but we feel a social responsibility to move
this forward.

I have included a short white paper of our data and a few articles to support our claims,

Dear Dr: Fauci,

Following my previous email regarding our work on developing strategies to attack
the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, i am attaching in this email our experimental results
demonstrating that 2 nucleotide analogues are inhibitors of the SARS-COV
polymerase. Since the SARS-CoV polymerase has over 96% similarity to the
polymerase from SARS-CoV-Z, we expect that the nucleotide analogues, 2’-F,Me-
UTP and 3’-F-dTTP, will also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase:

At this point, it is imperative that the prodrug forms (one is Sofosbuvir that is FDA
approved for HepC) of these molecules begin immediate in vitrc testing with
infected cells (similar to the studies carried out for Remdesivir and chloroquine in
the Cell Research article at the link, https://www.nature.com/articles/s4l422-020-
0282-0; PDF ﬁle of the article also attached) followed by animal testing trials
ASAP. Since we do not have access to the SARS—CoV—2 viral strains, we need your
assistance to identify resources at the NIH laboratories to embark on this next step

NIH Production to ICAN_000994 ""wmm

investigation ASAP. We can provide the prodrugs to the labs at NIH that you
identify for carrying out these studies. In view ofthe worldwrde SARS-CoV—2
emergency, we’d like your assistance in getting this off the ground ASAP.

I can be reached any time at 09(5)

Dear Drs. Fauci and Redﬂeld,

Scientists in my laboratory at Columbia University are actively engaged in design
strategies to cope with the new strain of coronaVirus, 2019»nCoV, which has
caused a global public health emergency. We have embarked on a project entitled
“Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors ofViral Polymerases”. We provide

a summary of this work below.

Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019»
nCoV. and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and
global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the
hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication
mechanismV we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA
(Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the
above coronaviruses, including 2019—nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral
agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral
polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the
development of Soiosbuvir with the use of 3‘-blocking groups that we have
previously built into nucleotide analogues that ﬁinction as polymerase
terminators.

Please let me know if you would like to receive the full manuscript.

Thank you very much for your consideration.

seem the r0 and CFR are more similar to ruheola than they are to Ehnla Can we
remind the public of that? Communicating that inﬂuenza will kill more Americans

Dear Dr. F auci,

I understand the need for the various stages of testing a new experimental vaccine. but in listening to
you give a iimeline for any new Vaccine for the coruna Vll’LIS, it struck me that perhaps a modiﬁed
approach might be considered. Why not allow early use of a Vaccine that has passed a phase 1 safety
testing, similar to what was done for the Ebola Vaccines, lfa vaccine is shown to be reasonably safe,
why not aiiuw its use it in mole at-nsk people (elderly, smokers) before phase 2 trials are ﬁnished. It
could also be helpful as with the Ebula Vaccines to prevent transmission in hot spots nfcommunity
acquired infections. There doesn‘t seem to be much downside compared to the potential for
preventing many more deaths than was seen in the Ebola situation.

Subject. RE. Curtinavirus

Hi again Tony. Herc's a link to a nonrtcchnical explanation ofthc paper 1 shared with you earlier:

 

 

I have seen predictions stating that upwards of 30% of the world's population will be infected, but I don't see this
happening. What I do see are lots of local outbreaks from imported cases some larger than others. but all heading
towards containment. I ﬁnd Israel to be an interesting test case. A group f infected Korean tourists who visited the
country only tested positive for coronavirus after their return to Korea. joining the large outbreak that has been
reported there. The itineran/ of their travel group has been made public so that retrospectively. Israeli public health
ofﬁcials could ascertain who was exposed where and when (see

httpszl/wwvt.health.gole/Eiiglish/News and Events/Spokespersons Messages/Pages/ZWZZOZO l.aspxi. Already
1.600 [smells have been quarantined on account of possible exposure. It has been twelve days since this group of
tourists returned to Korea. and no new infections have been reponed in Israel associated with this group (there are
two Israelis who were infected on the Diamond Princess cnlise ship. and one infected while in Italy). See
https:l‘/www.ynetnewscom/article/H lnXPa7ES. It will be interesting (and important) to see how many new
infections are detected in the days ahead. and it such new infections are found among those already under preventive
wtttch.

 

Nonetheless I totally concur with preparing as if major transmission will occur. Much better to err by over— rather
than under preparing (a familiar perspective front those bygone smallpox debates).

Finally, a reporter asked me yesterday afternoon wliatI wanted the President to say last nlglil. Here was my
rcsponsc.

In a sober wiry summarize the facts of the outbreak, suite that the US has an excellent preparedness team between
CDC and NIH, that at the advice of this team Lruvcl restrictions and quarantine measures have already been enacted,
but as ofnow the public is at very low risk ofinfcction. Still, ertizens should go to cdc.gov now to learn from our
experts how to prepare in the event that more extreme measures are needed, stay abreast ofthe situation here and
abroad and follow the advice of oilrexperts. get a ﬂu shot (I), and know that the us has a very strong public health
system that can withstand this challenge.

Anyway.just wanted to share all this with you. Keep up the good work and good luck with the vaccine research. Ed

It has been many years since we corresponded regarding smallpox biolermrism and vaccination control.

The attached paper on eonmtntng a community eoronavtrus outbreak from a few initial Cases vta isolation and
quarantine might interest you. The news is mostiy good - isolation and quarantine can get the transmission rate
below epidemic threshold - but the key is rapid detection of infected persons. AlSD discussed are some ideas for

on Molecular and Cellular Biology

 

Accelerating Life Science Discovery
Greetings,

In light of the current coronavirus situation, we would like to provide an update on your upcoming
Keystone Symposia conference.

The health and safety of our meeting attendees and speakers is our top priority, and we are carefully
monitoring the coronavirus situation around the world to ensure we ta Ke the necessary precautions as
recommended by healthcare providers and public health organizations

Currently, your meeting will proceed as scheduled, and we will contact you immediately if anything
changes. Decisions will be made on a moment to moment basis, as new information becomes available.
We assure you that the leadership team at Keystone Symposia is closely monitoring global
developments and will take swift action to ensure the health and safety of all meeting participants.

As a speaker, you hold a very special role at the meeting as a field leader. We very much appreciate
your contribution to both the scientific program, and the community of luminary scientists who Will
convene to direct the future ofthe field. Vour presentation will be a highlight for many attendees, and
your insights will inspire others to take on new and innovative directions in their own work. This isthe
essence of Keystone Symposia ~ convening communities of leading scientists to inspire each other to
advance biomedicine, and this would not be possible without your engagement.

We realize the current situation may add some inconveniences to travel at this time, but we also remind

you that each and every one of our speakers is handsselected by a committee of the world’s leading
experts to represent their field at the meeting. You are among a very select few to receive this honor.

NIH Production to ICAN_001006

The meeting organizers, and our team at Keystone Symposia, have put a great deal of time and effort
over the last two years into designing the program, and your presentation is a key part of that. We hope
you will take these thoughts into consideration as the meeting approaches.

While this is a time we must all be vigilant about public health measures, we are reminding conference
attendees that this is also a time to remain calm, rational and scientific in addressing the situation. We
encourage you to engage with your fellow colleagues at the meeting as you normally would, to forge
new collaborations and novel ideas that will drive your research and the field in innovative and fruitful
directions. At the meeting, we are providing the following suggestions based on recommendations from
the National Foundation of Infectious Disease:

- The best way to protect yourself against COVIDVIS is similar to how you would take
precautions against the cold orflu. Wash your hands often using soap and water for at least 20
seconds. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or the crook of your elbow rather than your
hands.

- There is no need to wear a face mask if you are well and do not have symptoms—masks
protect the sick from spreading germs but will not prevent you from getting sick.

- Do not assume that anyone of Asian descent is more likely to have comnavinls—do not forget
about the importance of inclusivityand evidence-based information.

Again, we thank you for your contributions and commitment to Keystone Symposia and wish for a very
successful and inspiring meeting.

Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I don’t believe that we've formally met, but I have seen you frequently on SSE as I admit patients there
and often participate in the ward rounds. lam an Alon several ofSteve Hollands protocols, and I often
help with the drugeresistant TE cases. I have been at the NIH now for over 4 years, although I still feel
like the new guy on the block! Most of my career has been focused on quantifying the infectious
aerosols generated by TB patients. I am very involved in the leadership of the American Thoracic
Society (ATS) as the Past Chair of the Assembly on Pulmonary Infections and TB. I am writing to invite
you to be a keynote speaker at a special Scientific Session being added to our International Conference
May 16—20 due to the emerging pandemic of COVID719. The exact time and data are not yet known,
but the conference is relatively close in Philadelphia. This would be an opportunity to address and
educate global academic leaders in pulmonary and critical medicine, infectious diseases, and public
health, We usually have over 15,000 attendees at the ATS meeting. I am attaching the email string
below to give you an idea of other speakers being considered.

I can only imagine how busy you must be now, so I apologize if this invitation is a distraction or a
nuisance, And I would certainly understand if you are unable to join us given the demands on yourtime,
but we would be absolutely delighted if you could speak.

Please feel to call or contact me at anytime with questions or comments.

Dear Dr Fauci,

Hope this mail ﬁnds you well. We had the opportunity to meet in Madrid during the RAW
meeting. I was the local chair ofthe Conference and had the privilege of introducing your talk to

the plenary.

I would like to invite you as plenary speaker to the meeting of the Spanish AIDS Society
(GESIDA) that will take place in Malaga. Spain next 30‘“ November 2020. GESIDA Congress is
the most imponant HIV national meetings in Spain that brings together the full “HIV
Community” including clinicians. basic researchers, experts in epidemiology and public health
and member from NGOs and patients' associations. Overall 700 attendees are expected to come
to the meeting.

We would love to have you as a speaker in the Opening Plenary Session in evening the 30‘h
November. Your challenging articles regarding the strategies to end the HIV epidemic in the
United States, will be a great topic to be addressed in such session and an inspiration to Spanish
researchers. Ifyou prefer to talk about a different topic as the co-morbidities scenario in HIV
infection it will be welcome too.

We would be more than happy if you could participate in this meeting.

It'know your agenda is always full, even more these days with the current Coronavirus outbreak,

NIH Production to ICAN_001026 NIH-001209

but ifyou could accept this invitation I think this can represent a real boost in the ﬁghl against
HIV epidemics in Spain, a ﬁeld in which the Spanish AIDS Society is strongly committed.

It would we wonderful if we can have you as a speakei:

Best wishes

David Rubenstein asked that we reach out to you in an effort to schedule an Economic Club of
Washington event that would feature Dr. Fauci in a conversation with David on COVID-19. It is

my understanding that David had a similar interview with Dr. Fauci in the last week or 50.

Below are several dates from David’s calendar for your consideration.
Wednesday, April 22 — Breakfast

NIH Production to ICAN_001028 ""“mm‘

Tuesday, April 28— Breakfast or lunch
Tuesday, May 5 — Breakfast or Lunch

Friday, May 15— Lunch

Additionally, I have attached an invitation letter from Mr. Rubenstein to Dr. Fauci for your
convenience. The Economic Club hasthe ability to turn around an event in a relatively short
period of time. As you may recall, our events typically take place at breakfast, lunch or dinner,
at downtown Washington, D.C. hotels. Events that feature a prominent world leader, such as
Dr. Fauci, generally attract a select audience of over 500 members and guests from among
Washington’s business and government leaders, as well as the diplomatic corps.

We understand the complexities and constraints of Dr. Fauci’s schedule and can be responsive
to his needs. If none of the dates above work With Dr. Faucl’s schedule, please suggest some
that will and we will work with David to confirm a date and begin the process. I have copied
Judi lrastorza, who I believe you have worked with in the past, and she will coordinate anything

you need.

Subject: Lack of preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic
Importance: High

Dear Dr. Collins and Dr. Fauci,

lam sorry to say that our lack of preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic has
its roots in the way biomedical research is funded in the United States, as well as
in the lack of leadership and vision on the part of NIH and its institutes since the
SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2003. I try to expand on these problems in the
article below. I would welcome your response to my thesis.

Sincerely,

The Wuhan Coronavirus(COVID-19): Why there is no cure or vaccine

NIH Production to ICAN_001032 "'“012‘5

In their Medical Virology text published in 1994, DD. White and FJ. Fenner stated
“No convincing evidence has yet been obtained to link human coronaviruses with
serious disease ..., but they are an important cause ofthat trivial but annoying
disease, the common cold." This generalization changed drastically with the
emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2002-2003
(SARS-CoV), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) immediately sought the
expertise of these two scientists at the time. Now, 17 years later, we still do not
have an antiviral medicine or a vaccine against the novel coronavirus that
originated in China, now designated as COVID—19 by the World Health
Organization (WHO). On February 21, there were 75,567 cases and 2,239 deaths
in China; and 1,152 cases outside China, with 8 deaths, according to the Director,
General of the WHO. The two viruses appear to use the same gate (or “receptor"]
on host cells to infect them. Despite such expected similarities between new and
old strains of the virus, research on coronaviruses has not been a priority for the
National Institute of Allergy and infectious Diseases (NIAID). In the end, all that
the Director of NlAlD was able offer is "good healthcare” as a remedy for COVID-
19 infections.

The major reason we do not have a cure for coranaviruses is that there has been
no coordinated effort by the NlAlD to establish long-term research programs
focused on coronaviruses. Realizing the insufficient progress in this area,

the NIAID announced on February 6 a “Notice of Special Interest to highlight the
urgent need for research on the 2019 novel Coronavirus.” Grants have indeed
been awarded to some scientists since 2003, but such grants are highly
competitive, with success rates of applications to NIAID between 14 and 18%,
indicating that 82-86% of applicants are unable to obtain funding to carry out
research. The time and effort spent on preparing grant applications to NIH are
enormous, diverting these precious resources from actual research to what some
scientists call “grantsmanship” (essentially, the ability to sell your idea to a review
committee!). These ”games scientist play" to procure funding are a hindrance to
the progress of science. Thefact that we do not have a cure or a vaccine against
coronaviruses over the past 1 7 years since the SARS epidemic, attests to this
detrimental effect.

Development of a vaccine against COV/D-19t is also not straightforward. SARS
was probably not considered by NIH to be an important pathogen on which to

NIH Production to ICAN_001033

spend resources. Even if the biomedical research community had developed a
vaccine against coronaviruses, pharmaceutical companies would probably not
have considered it a profitable endeavor. Therefore, it is essentiolfor pub/icfunds
to be used by NlH and the CDC to both discover an effective vaccine and to
manufacture it.

We need to ensure that long-term projects to develop antivirals and vaccines
against coronaviruses and other infectious agents, including tuberculosis and
influenza virus, are implemented and fully funded. We need to have afunding
system that does not depend on the often unfounded criticism or whims of grant
reviewers. Although the current peer review system is touted generally as the
best way to allocate funding, it has never been tested scientifically against an
alternative. While half of the NlH budget (currently $39 billionl may still be
allocated for high-cost projects, including clinical trials, the other half should be
awarded for periods of 10 years or longer to established scientists who have a
track—record of scientific work, as well as to young scientists who are starting their
first independent position. The budgets of these grants would be somewhat
limited, but would provide uninterrupted funding and alleviate the stress of
competing for renewals every 3—5 years. Scientists opting for these grants will not
have to submit extensive grant applications. More importantly, this system will
more than double the number of independent investigators. After a 10—12 year
period, the scientific productivity (per grant dollar) of scientists on the classical
grant system would be compared with that of scientists on long-term funding.
After all, the way we choose the mode ofscience funding should conform to the
way science progresses, by experimentation and analysis.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

This is HJ from NPR again. I was wondering if you could confirm a NYT report that says the White House
has instructed you not to say anything about the coronavirus outbreak without prior approval

Kind regards,

I am reaching to you with thi dea that might sound weird but I think it might be helpful. I have this idea
to reduce the coronavirus infection and spreading. It is very simple but can get more complex as well.

Tony,

As you are acutely aware, the COVlD-19 situation is on everyone’s mind and accordingly there have
been questlorls raised by members of the AAAAI about what the organization can do to provide more
guidance in this evolving situation. In light of this linked to the fact that our annual meetlng begins
March 13 in Philadelphia, we have made the decision to have a 45-60 minute session in the main hall on
Saturday (March 14) morning from 7:00—8:00 prior to the scheduled plenary session slated to start at
8:15. My question is whether you would considertaking the Acela up Friday evening returning Saturday
morning to host this session With a presentation followed bya Q&A session. If that is not possible,
would you be willing to provide a 10—15 minute (shorter if you deem that appropriate) video generated
as close to the 140'
latter, would you have a suggestion of an ID person in Philadelphia who would be knowledgeable and
could field questions following yourvideo. I recognize that even if you are willing to come to
Philadelphia, that circumstances could arise that would preclude your traveling in which case we would
askfor a video if at all possible. Finally, if neither option is possible, is there somebody in DC (including
NIH), Baltimore or Philadelphia who could provide the short review and then sit for 30~45 minutes of
Q&A. I am well aware that this is last minute and you have been incredibly busy with issues related to
the pandemic, any help you could provide would be much appreciated by my colleagues and me

Tom

Subject: Invitation to speak at National Academies workshop

Dear Dr. Fauci,

It is my pleasure to invite you to present at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine workshop on “The Critical Public Health Value of Vaccines —Tackling Issues of Access and
Hesitancyt” Thisworkshop Will be held on May 2849, 2020 at the Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO) headquarters in Washington, DC. The statement of task forthe workshop is attached.

The 1.57day workshop will provide a venue to examine the current state of vaccine preventable diseases
and the impact of vaccine access and hesitancy on vaccine preventable diseases globally, as well as the
multidimensional drivers and impacts of declining vaccine confidence. This workshop will explore health
systems, research opportunities, communication strategies, and policies that could be considered to
address access, perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors toward vaccination. The workshop will be
broadcast live overthe web to an international audience, and is being hosted by the National
Academies' Forum on MicrobialThreats.

Due to your in-depth expertise in thisfield, we would like to invite you to give a plenary presentation on
the development of new vaccines in the midst of an outbreak, specifically on the prospects of a
coronavirus vaccine. The primary audience for the event will be researchers, health practitioners,
industry leaders, and policy makers in infectious diseases and global health, so we are looking to initiate
this workshop with relevant discussions of barriers to accessing vaccines. Vour responsibilities would be
to prepare and deliver a 15—minute presentation. We would cover your travel expenses in accordance
With U.S, federal government rules. We would be thankful to have your involvement in this workshop.
Please let me know ifyou might be interested. I would be happy to answerany questions you may have.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. We understand that this is a very busy time and
your calendar may be in flux.

Best wishes.

Thanks for the note. If we start in April ( ~6-7 weeks from now) with a phase 1
trial of 45 subjects, it will take another 3-4 months to determine safety and some
immunogenicity. The next step is phase 2 for efficacy. We may need help with
resources for the phase 2 trial if we do not get our requested budget
supplement. I believe that we will be OK. If this goes off track, I will contact
you. Many thanks for the offer. Much appreciated.

Hi there,

I'm writing for Healthline about coronavirus and how the Virus spread may be different in the
Southem Hemisphere (they mention Ihal in the story below). Care to weigh in?

I‘d love to know:

1, Will coronavirus be any less severe in the Southern Hemisphere due to the summer weather there
81 (hi: moment?

2, Will the virus spread in North America slow down due to geography or warmer weather at all?
What can we expect in 3 monthseeand in one year as far as coronavirus in the U.S,'.7

3, win it differ in how it spreads/tapers offin Asia, due to proximity of the outbreak?

4 will this eventually be gone or will it be something that is a new health threat that could return in a
year or so?

5. Any insight into the outlook of coronavirus, how it will spread or how long it will be active?

Looking for a brief email response by Monday morning at 10 am. Let me know if you can assist!
Warmly,

On behalf of Ms. Gap ath:
Dear Professor Fauci:

We are contacting you in the context of the evolving spread of Covid-19, which is already impacting
livelihoods and economic activity in several countries. As you may know, the IMF publishes forecasts of
economic growth for member countries four times a year, as well as macroeconomic policy
recommendations. In that context, it would be invaluable for us to hear public health experts’ views on
the likely trajectory of the virus—the number of people that are likely to get infected in different
countries and the likely time path. We would also benefit from hearing experts’ views on the optimal
public health policy response in different types of countries (countries with stronger or weaker health
systems, different development levels, etc.), and the implied resource needs.

We are planning to set up a conference call with several experts to discuss these issues and were
wondering if you would be available to join us. if you would be interested in joining, would you be able

NIH Production to ICAN_001061 "mum“

to let my assistant Lucia Buono (lbuonoQimforg) know of some dates and times that would work for

We would be extremely grateful for any guidance you might be able to offer as we strive to do our part
in helping member countries respond to the epidemic‘

Dear Tony,

Ijust had an OpEd accepted in the WSJ proposing the use of convalescent sera to stem the coronawrus
epidemic. The text of the OpEd l5 below In blue font (scroll down). I am sure the WSJ will shorten It and
edit it but at least you have an advance copy of it. Ijust wanted you to have it since the WSJ is read
widely in DC and I don't want anyone blindsiding you with questions about it.

As you knowl have been long proponent of passive antibody therapies in infectious diseases and there
is a huge body of historical data supporting this approach. Certainly, with modern blood banking
techniques this option can be made quite safe and administration of a few cc’s of serum could confer
immediate immunity to those who will be exposed ~ like ER staffs I hope you agree with the message
and like it.

Thank you for all you are doing forthe country and humanity, lfyou need me for anything in this crisis
rest assured that I am here.

Warm rega rds,

Dear Mr. Varadarajan,

I wonder if the W5} is interested in my OpEd. I am trying to get a message out that
convalescent serum (e.g. serum ﬁ'om people who recover) can be used to stem the coronavirus
epidemic if administered to exposed people, This has been known for over a century, and is
well accepted, but not widely 101on, even among experts today. There was one report that
China was beginning to stockpile serum but Ihere has been almost no discussion of this option
among world public health authorities. Although I can get this published in a medical journal
my hope is to publish it instead in a venue of high readership since this is something that can
be done today to stem the epidemic. I am hoping that given the economic consequences of the
outbreak that the W3] is interested. I included a hriefbio below. Thanks for looking at this,

Oh, i see what they are getting at. They examined at the single cell level the expression ofRNA for ACHZ, which
is the receptor for the Coronavirus in the lung ,and found that when they looked at various demographic groups there
was greater expression of this receptor in Asian malesr They are thus hinting that this is the reason why there was
such an explosion of infections in China. This is possible, but the lowest level ms in Northern Italians and take a
look at what is happening in Nonhern Italy. I do not mean to put the paper down since there may be some truth in
it. However, this journal (bioinv) is not peer reviewed and the data are skimpy. Someone should do a more

Hi,
Sorry for the late response, I just flew back frorr (b) (5).

NIAD doesn’t have ongoing trials with chloroquine and I heard that such trials are being conducted in
China.

We are planning to evaluate chloroquine in animal models ASAP. lfany therapeuticwith a good clinical
safety profile( like chloroquine) appears to be effective in vivo against COVIDA19, we are planning to
quickly add to them to the Remdesivir therapeutic trial as another arm,

Let me know if you have other questions:

HiTony,

Quick question —who would you suggest is the appropriate NIH representative for this ASPR-led
trans-HHS effort to coordinate COVlD»19 response? You and I will be testifying in front of the
House Approps Subcommittee on Wednesday morning. Would it be best for Larry to represent
NIH for the ASPR gathering (though he would normally attend the House hearing), or is there
someone from NIAID that would be most appropriate?

Thanks, Francis

Dear ASPR Colleagues,

We are at a critical juncture in our nation’s response to COVlD—lg. As we pivot from
containment of the virus to mitigation of its impacts, it is imperative that HHS moves
swiftly, transparently, and in a unified mannerto protect lives and save Americans. The
Secretary has charged my office to lead efforts across the Department to prepare and
defend our health care system during the novel coronavirus outbreak through the
Health Care System Resilience Task Force,

To date, this task force has engaged with public and private sector stakeholders to
broadly identify efforts that can be taken to help ensure preparedness in response to a
domestic COVlD-19 outbreak, and more importantly their gaps, challenges, and
potential areas of need from the federal government. Now, we must build on that
knowledge to expedite and execute a whole of HHS response to support protection of
the health care system that spans public health, health care, and human services.

Please join Dr. Kevin Yeskey, ASPR's Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Preparedness and Response, and Dr. Nancy Messonnier, CDC's Director of the National
Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, on Wednesday, March 4 from 9:00
AM - 10:15 AM, at the O’Neill House Office Building for a working session to align
current activities and next steps to be executed as part of a coordinated HHS response
to COVID719.

Please provide the following information to ASPR.HCSRTF@hhs.gov no later than

Monday, March 2 at 12:00 PM, and be prepared to share and discuss at Wednesday’s
session.

Hi Tony and Larry,

See below for a new Health Care Resilience Task Force being convened by ASPR.

The initial meeting overlaps with our House approps hearing,

Tony, who shall we send to this one?

FC

PS. to Tony— I’m getting a lot of buzz about the Israeli claim to have fast track vaccine:
httDs://israelb.org/ZO20/02/israel-to»have-coronavirus-vaccine-within-3-weeks/ It looks to me
that they are conflating having something ready to put into volunteers for a phase 1 trial, and

having full scale production ready to go for the global needs. That still seems like it’s a year
away. Am I right?

Subject: Urgent information about a Corona Virus Management Device

Dear Dr. Fauci

Given the gravity of the corona pandemic, my brother and I are reaching out
to make you aware of product that we think could help mitigate the spread of
the virus and protect health care workers as well as the public, We have
already tried the usual channels to contact the White House and the
emergency authorization use division at the FDA but also wanted to bring
this to your attention also.

MedixairT'V1

, an ultraviolet (UVc) air sterilizer with proven, well established
unique patented germicidal technology to effectively and safely eradicate
viruses and bacteria up to 99.9%. It is capable of delivering a loge reduction
in microbial concentration, by penetrating the nucleus of microorganisms,
disrupting their DNA thus destroying the ability of the organism to reproduce;
effectively rendering it harmless.

MedixairTM is a portable unit and can easily be installed in a variety of

settings including hospitals, emergency rooms, waiting rooms, dentist
offices, cruise ships and airport lounges. In both clinical trials and under in-
vitro testing conditions (see attached white paper), MedixairTM has been
demonstrated to be highly effective in protecting patients and health care
workers from pathogens (e.g. MRSA, Clostridium Difﬁcile) and also by
preventing cross infection. Specifically, MedixairTM was tested and found
effective for a strain of Coronavirus known as FCoV and thus COVID-19
would have the same susceptibility to eradication with UVc within a relatively
short period of time (attached).

 

Medixair1M has been on the market since 2005 and is fully CE marked to EN
standards. Currently it has been safely and effectively used in acute
hospitals, dental surgeries, in UK, Malaysia, lndia, Israel, and Southern
Africa,

Please let us know how we can help make these units available for use in
the US during this critical period of time.

Kind regards,

Subject: Question from Jefferson Health NE Philadelphia
Hi Dr. Fauci,

Hope all is well.

Dr. Fauci, we will be setting up COVlD-19 testing facilities and I wanted to ask your opinion
regarding the following:

Is it ok to expand our testing beyond the current strict testing criteria to include those with
lesser symptoms or potential exposure whom we want to rule out Covid»]9?

We are concerned that while we isolate those with more severe symptoms who currently
qualify for testing, the majority with lesser symptoms would be ambulatory and potentially
spreading the illness to others. Plus, it is hard to get someone to isolate for 14 days without
providing a diagnosis.

Just as we can test those we suspect for Influenza A, Influenza B and RSV, it would be helpful to
be able to test those we suspect with Covld—IB, including healthcare workers with no symptoms
but with possible exposure.

Thank you for your time and your leadership for our nation's healthcare.

Be well.

Dr Fauci,

Is it possibie that the varicella vaccine could be playing a role in why children are not presenting with the
COVID»19 virus? If the vaccine became common around 1995, we would be seeing little to no infection
ofchildren and young adults up to about 25 years old, which seems to be the case Could something in
the varicelia vaccine have provided immunity to comm-19?

Just an Idea from a concerned citizen".

you. Ideally, though, we could make this happen soon (to state the obvious, everyone is feeling the
need for touchpoints right now, and you are a wonderfully calming one rorour university rnernlsersll.

We could arrange the teleconference for as early as this Monday, the 16th: ifthere is a 30-minute
window for you or a designee between 1:00 pm and 3:00 pm on that day or within that same block of

time Tuesday, the 17‘“, we'll commandeer it!

I am medical director ot‘a charity clinic in Naples, Florida. Although we try to screen pts for
cough, fever, sore throat, URI sxs, dyspnea or unusual fatigue, apparently some patients are
asymptomatic and neg for these 5 hallmarks but still contagious, There is conﬂict between what
our Florida governor states and what CDC states. Do you believe all of our staff should be in
goggles, mask, gown and gloves for AAL PATIENTS that we treat regardless of not meeting one
of the 5 screening criteria above. If indeed there is community spread happening, I and many
others are sitting ducks. It is not if but whenl!

Thanks for any guidance you might be able to provide. lam copying to my adminisn'ative staff

Tony. So good to see you now on TV in full charge. Your entire expression has changed
almost like when I bumped into you in the Washington Metro after you had gotten off
the plane with President Bush.

I have an interesting question regarding pneumococcal polysaccharide immunization.
One of our staff members phoned. Her father is a physician in France and has many
physician acquaintances. She was told that the doctors believe that the older patients
who received pneumococcal vaccine have less of a mortality than those who did not get
the vaccine.

When we did the studies and got the pneumococcal vaccine approved for the elderly in
1976 there was a battle about who should get it and whether was cost-effective. Since
then, other studies have documented the beneﬁt, especially in older people and you
probably have received it. It is now routine but I know many elderly individuals have
not gotten immunized. Historically, many, if not the majority of deaths from inﬂuenza
in some of the past epidemics was a result of secondary infection with pneumococcus.
I'm not hearing anything about urging people to get immunized with pneumococcal
vaccine. The message would need to be clear so they don't confuse pneumococcal
secondary infection with primary coronavirus infection. It would be a good idea for
people to be urged to get the pneumococcal vaccine. If they had not received it. I‘m
not seeing any recommendations from the CDC or elsewhere regarding this.

lmuortance: High

Hi Dr. Fauci.

l have been following the news and some interviews with yourself. I was hoping you would be willing to
speak with me about our technology?

Testing for the positive patients and ﬁnding a vaccme are essential. but containment is paramount.

We have the only GERM CONTAlNMENT TECHNOLOGY 0' it‘s kind.

The ongoing Coronavtrus and FLU Viruses pose a signiﬁcant threat to public health globally and here in
the US.

We have the most poweriul solution to minimize inieclion and maximize protection against SARS,
EBOLA. FLU, and all types at germs and viruses.

With local 3rd party tested efﬁcacy of 100%. no other technology anywhere can ylelo this result or
sustainable 24/7/365 protection.

XTl02 is a world exclusive containment technology with self-cleaning functions that can help minimize the
risk at cross—conlamination in hospitals. planes. public transportation. elevators. and public places.

XTlOZ technology works by lormmg an invisible protective layer on mostly ALL material surfaces (plastic.
steel. glass. fabric. paper, walls. etc. .). it is green. sustainable. and has yielded up to 100% efﬁcacy
proven by $68 LABS (US).

 

I look forward to hearing from you and attached is an information ﬁle for your review.

Thank you‘

Slr.

I appreciate the effort of your entire team in identiﬁcation and resolution of the
predicament the chinese government has gotten us into. That said, I believe you
might add a more proactivc edge by mining existing data, You'rc going to have to

dig deep.

It seems that the common denominator in originating vector, at least by your news
releases, is plainly travel-related co-mingling of persons not otherwise in

contact Therefore. I would propose that there is a great trove of existing data
waiting to be ﬁltered within the travel manifests' history ofUS-bnund airlines and
US-bound cruise vessels. Suggest as a start the collection of every manifest from the
last 4 months or so. ﬁltered and compared with principle contractecs known to exist
in the US, and list every other person on said aircraft’vessel that disembarked on US
soill DO NOT WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO GET SICK - Employ the National Guard
and Coast Guard to track these folks and put a swab in their nose. It‘positive, then
contact (race this smaller group. If negative maintain them on the list and force
compliant reporting if they develop suspected symptoms,

I know it would seem to be a lot of work. However, I presume your are familiar with
the FRAM Oil FIltcr Guy from the 19705. where it's better to pay now than

later because you're going to pay one way or another Get a proactivejump on

Dear Dr. Fauci;

I live in— Last week there was the ﬁrst incidence
of the Coronavirus. The ofﬁcials in Media gave no true information on the
individual but that it was a female, When questioned by the press as to the location
in which the individual was -the response was that that information could not be
given. [ have also heard that it is in a violation of a person’s privacy. No one is

asking for the person's name or address If the public were given the general area of
the affected person they would probably stay clear of the area. The people directly in
the area would he more cautious. Knowmg where the person frequented, for
example, the market would be pertinent in preventing spread of this virus. There is
so much information about this virus Ihat is unknown yet most ofﬁcials continue to
underscore the severity of this virus,

Evening Dr. Fauci,

My name is David Craig and I am one ofthe Founders of the Medsoft Group, a
Analytics, Telemetry and Reporting medical platform out of Canada. We would like
to offer oursolution to the NIH free of charge, much like we have done with Dr.
Bruce Aylward and the World Health Organitation earlier today.

Our application will track, log and provide a pathway to true two-way real time
communication of COVlD-19 as citizens around the US report their symptoms on
their mobile device. We are currently implementing our technology with our
partners at: the University of Alberta, but we would like to refocus our immediate
attention in helping With the novel coronaVIrus.

Deployment of our application would allow the NIH to manage and understand
potential clusters and outbreaks of the pandemic, taking advantage of the
estimated 96% of Americans that use a smart phone to easily record a potential
case, providing all stakeholders across the US with the latest information.
Medsoft Group is ready to ofter this immediately and without delay. With your
cooperation we believe we could be upand running within a week, providingthis
invaluable tool to better understanding where and what the virus is doing around
the country in real time.

Please let me know if you would like to speak further. We would be happy to
demonstrate our technology as well as discuss how we would put this ambitious
plan into place.

Subject: Prevalence of smoking, and reported mortality rates in COVlD-l9

To whom it may concern:

I assert that the frequency ofclmieally signiﬁcant disease, as well as severe disease
and mortality of COVID-l‘) is much higher in smokers, as is the case with any
pulmonary infection, such as inﬂuenza, or bacterial pneumonia.

This is clearly in addition to that due to the
prevalence ofelderly and immunocompromised patients; but smoking status overall
may be a more signiﬁcant risk factor for clinically signiﬁcant disease,

In listening to the news media, smoking has not been addressed as a signiﬁcant risk
factor for disease,

I would suspect that smoking is at least one reason that such a high mortality has
recently been seen in Italy, and China, and I expect that mortality rates. as well as
rates of clinically signiﬁcant cases, will also be increased in other populations with
increased prevalences of smokers. and strongly associated with the prevalence of
smoking in the given population.

Of course, the reporting of severe disease will be modulated by the effectiveness of
the given population in containing the virus, as well as the effective reporting of
clinical disease within the Community, whether severe or not

In listening to the news media, smoking has not been addressed as a significant risk
factor for disease, I think that it should be addressed.

One wonders ifit could he a modiﬁable risk factor‘ at least in certain patients (such
as those who have not smoked for very long).

 

One also wondeis Whﬂhﬂ’ this could be anulher good prognostic factor for limited
rcponcd/ clinically signiﬁcant cases (and thus limited perceived spread) in the
United Slales, obviously in addition 10 our early, effective conlalnmenl measures,

Hi Dr, Anthony Fauei,

I saw you on Meet Ihe Press this weekend and you were so awesome! Very
informative, calm, assuring but with the right amount of instilling the need for us all
to move forward With the appropriate caution for ourselves It's extremely reassuring
to have you leading and guiding us during this time.

I'm emailing you because lwork at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in -
_. Our administration initially said if any Covid-l9 patient came into the
hospital needing emergeny care and needing to be admitted they would be given an
N95 mask and put in a negative pressure FOOmt Now they reversed that decision and
said they'd be put in a regular positive pressure roomn even after I showed them the
CDC's recommendation for both conﬁmed and possible Cov1d-l9 cases needing to
be placed in negative pressure rooms/AIIR.

Well tonight a possible Covid»l9 patient came to the Emergency Room and had to
be admitted to the ICU, The patient was given just a regular mask and put in an
elevator to the ICU. Management would not confirm if the patient was in a negative
pressure mom and wouldn't give staff N95 masks. 1 again showed them the CDC
website hospital protocol Covid-19 recommendations but same response, And even
was yelled at by the hospital nursing supervisor for asking about it.

I feel this is not safe at all for other patients. visitors and staff if the air is being
recirculated not vented outside or through a hepa ﬁlter before recirculating hack

 

through the has ital. I don't know what to do. Please hel ,The hos ital main hone

I know you're extremely hwy now but any help or guidance is appreciated..even if

Subject: Fields Symposium
Dear Tony,

lam sorry to write that we are going to have to cancel the Fields Symposium for April 24th, but we will
reaschedule when we can. As you may know, Harvard has cancelled all meetings larger than 100 (and

this morning limited that to 25) through at least April 30th. We are sad to have to do this, but we need
to help mitigate the spread of the virus. Harvard even told the undergraduates today to go home this
weekend and take their classes on line for maybe even the rest of the semester.

Thank you lor all you are doing to keep everyone informed about the coronavirus outbreak. We are
going to give you the Harvard ”Veritas” award when you are next here.

Stay well.
Best regards,

David

Dear Prof. Anthony Fauci,

At ﬁrst, I express regret if lam bothering you in your busy schedule.

I know you care about asymptomatic infection of COVfD-19. COVID-19 is
spreading rapidly all over the world, especially in Iran and Italy, and possibly even
more widely. Asymptomatic infections and healthy carriers are possible sources for
uansmission. However, such sources of infection cannot be effectively identiﬁed due
to the symptoms absent The research evidence is very lacking so far.

 

This encourages me to write to you to seek help! I will be most grateful if you could
give us some suggustion.

Look forward to hearing from you soon,

With kind regards,

Youxs sincerely,

Dear Tony:

If you can find a few minutes, I would very much like to talk with you briefly about a new diagnostic
LAMP test for coronavirus COVID~19 that we have developed here at NEB. I attach a paper now in the
Medeiv that brieﬂy describes the test. It has been used already in Wuhan and because of its simplicity.
speed and visual output we think it would be very useful for use here in the US, We havejust met with
several people at Mass General Hospital and will be working with them for local validation here in MA
The test itself is very inexpensive, does not require any special equipment nortrainlng of technicians
This would appear ideal for the FDA and the CDC to know about, but I have not so far been able to reach

 

either Slephen Hahn or Robert Redfield. I would emphasize that our goals are to help deal with the
humanitarian aspects of the current problems.

ultimately sold the company to a public competitor, DJO Globali I have worked on

was to introduce what I believe is a disruptive product to help healtheare

Nick.

Following up on our conversation this weekend, I am including some informatiuri belnw about our Remote Patient
Monitoring platform which we are making available for lree to health agencies and organizations participating in
the response to comp-19 in the United States.

Remote Patient Monitoring with FOIIOWAW ls a HIPArHZompliant system that helps health officials to diagnose,
contain and treat this highly transmissible viral threat by enabling the effective screening oflarge numbers of
potential patients and to triage/prioritize targeted clinical interventions including the use of test kits.

FollowApp's monitoring dashboard and patient mooile applications [ins and Android) can be used to delivertwa or
the keys to an etiective respunse plan: 1) encourage “self-quarantin‘lng’ la iundamenial epidemiologic tenet) and
2) otfioad exploding clinical volume threatening hospital Emergency Departments. Healthcare systems are thus
able to maintain important contact with these populations and recommend targeted escalation of care when
needed, while decreasing exposure to both clinicians and other patients.

The public perception orthe lethality oitnisgiohai pandemic is fueling panic which, in and or Itself, is creating Its
own logistic issues thatare already beginning to overwhelm hospital Emergency Departments.The dilemma for

health care systems,then, becomes a question of identifying subpopulations atincreased risk while at the same
time, keeping these patients out oithe hospital.

Please reel iree to forward this email along with my contact information (celi— ., i would be happyto
provide a demo to anyone who may be interested,

Carissimo Dr. Fauci -

Greetings from Munich, Germany! It's hard to believe so many years have passed since
our time working avian inﬂuenza preparedness. I have watched every single interview

during the past few months and I could not be more relieved to see you at the helm of

this new, rapidly evolving crisis.

I know you have very little time, so I will make this quick - hopefully to be followed by a
more fulsome and proper hello.

We have a prominent American businessman (age 64) here in Munich who tested

positive a little over a week ago after skiing in the Dolomites in Italy. He has a history
of respiratory illnessa, including double pneumonias and various other similar
complications. In short, he is sedated and intubated, and was placed on ECMO during
the past 24 hours. The team is administering ritonavir and lopinavir, as well as broad
spectrum antibiotics,

The German doctor here would like to acquire Remdesivir to have on hand if all other
treatments fail. Because it is not being tested here, he inquired whether we could
access it in the States. Would you be able to point me in the right direction for how, if
even possible, we could transfer some to the Munich-based hospital here?

Thank you so much in advance. Any other insights of course are certainly welcome.
You continue to be a national treasure. All the best - Rita

Hi Trevor,

Truly interesting opportunity. Tony is doinga media blitz (Sean Hannity on Fox right now) but
I’m sure he will check in — and I would imagine that VF Pence will turn to him to decide how to
respond to Bill’s phone call. DoctorAbased testing capability in the US has gone up substantially
in the last couple of days — after admittedly a rocky start. But home testing presents a novel
detection scheme. I assume from what you say that false negatives are uncommon and false
positives are rare?

 

For Africa, this seems like a technology that ought to be deployed as soon as possible. It
astounds me that there are no documented cases in East Africa yet — that deﬁes everything we
know about air traffic with China. Prowding an opportunity for low-tech testing in Addis, or
Kampala, or Nairobi, or Dar es Salaam seems like a highly desirable outcome.

My two cents

Subject: COVlD-IS
Dear Francis, Tony,

I wanted to glve you a heads up on a call that Bill will have with Vice President Pence tomorrow around
the CUVlD-IS situation. As you might be aware, we have been running an influenza transmission study
in Seattle for the last 2 years, This involves at-home testing for |Ll~symptomatic individuals (who log-in
via a web app) and collection of nasal swabs, which are then sequenced for a range of respiratory
pathogens. Dan can give you more details on this study if you have questions. When the coronavirus
situation arose, we added this to the list of pathogens and hence were able to detect some of the early
cases in Washington.

The CDC has been very interested in the approach and at one point we had the highest screening
capacity in the US (though only 400 samples per day, sol hope this is no longer true). At the same time,
we have developed a COVlD-19 at-home screening and Information system with robust software that
approximates what China was doing but also takes into account the opt-ln requirements that are
necessary in the US.

We want to propose going beyond the Seattle area- this would be gated only by availability of testing.
We can deploy this readyenow system more broadly in the US. Ideally we would also do a parallel
outreach to some African countries. I’d be interested in your views and would be happy tojump on a

Subject: CoV collaboration with Polish Medical Research Agency

Dear Dr. Sierpinski,

Dr. Fauci referred your message to me and other NIAID colleagues with a request that we
respond on his behalf so as to avoid further delay We certainly sympathize with your
situation, as we also are working urgently to prevent, control and manage COVID-lB in the
United States.

During his visit to NIH in 2018, I was pleased to meet Minister Slumowski and, although I
was traveling when you visited Dr. Fauci last year, I am aware that the meeting was
productive and that we remain interested in encouraging further UlS.-Po|and scientific
collaboration, In part, as a result at that meeting, we are also very pleased to be planning
an NIH and ABM-sponsored clinical research training workshop in Poland later this year

As you are likely aware, NIAID is collaborating with a number of organilations to develop
vaccines for SARS-Cov-Z. We are expecting the first vaccine to start Phase I trials within the
next month. As vaccines move through Phase l testing, there may be opportunities to
collaborate

In addition, with NIAID as the regulatoryspunsor, we have initiated a randomized,
controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efﬁcacy oi the investigational antiviral

 

remdesivir in hospitalized adults diagnosed with COVlD-19. This adaptive design trial will
allow for the addition of new treatment arms as promising new therapeutics for COVID-19
become available Eventually, this trial may be expanded to include international sites,
potentially including some that have been affiliated with our INSIGHT Network in the
pasta Three sites in Poland have participated in INSIGHT trials:

Site Name: Wroclawskie Centrum Zdrowia (Wroclaw)
Site Leader: Brygida Knysl

Site Name: Wojewodzki Szpital Zakazny (Warsaw)
Site Leader: Andrzej Jerzy Horban

Site Name: Uniwersytecki Szpital Kliniczny (Bialystok)
Slte Leader: Robert Flisiak

It might be a good idea to let any Polish sites/investigators considering participation in this
trial know that ABM might have available funding to support international collaborative
research, if that is the case. This may be important information as Polish scientists interact
with other European scientists considering the development of a multi-site clinical trial.

in addition, there may be other opportunities for collaborative research engaging Polish
institutions with access to COViD-19 patients, particularly through the sharing of biological
samples and research data. Another approach would be for interested Polish scientists to
explore shared interests with U5. colleagues who are planning to apply for CDVID-19

funding in response to current Funding Opportunity Announcements in the NIH Guide to
Grants and Contracts. To do what we can to facilitate possible collaborations, we would
also welcome receiving additional information on specific COVlD-19 research interests,
capabilities and activities current in Poland,

Thank you again for reaching out to Dr. Fauci. We look forward to continuing to discuss
potential areas ofcollaborationt

Dear Doctor Fauci,

I hope this e »mail is finding you well and your efforts in fight against
Coronayirus epidemics is giving some effects. As you know in Poland we have
currently 15 cases of CW infection and we are also fighting mostly with
general society worries than epidemics. We would like also to take part in
research on CoV vaccine or drug and Polish Medicai Research Agency is
planning to start financing some project on it as soon as possible. Both polish
medical universities and institutes are fully prepared to take part in such
project.

On behalf of Polish Minister of Health Prof. Lukasz Szumowski I would like to
kindly ask you for some support and collaboration options with NIH in this
very delicate issue. Maybe NIH can take some advisory role in our scientific
project or Polish scientists may take some part in your work bilaterally.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Dr. Fauei:

I appreciated your ofﬁce calling me last Thursday regarding my email concern
below on the Covid 19 virus epidemic. The fact that China has a larger percentage

of smokers in its population may have something to do with the faster spreading of
the virus there. Male smokers out number females by a huge number and are
therefore dying in much higher numbers because of that fact,

Has anyone at CDC looked into when a person is around cigarette smokers that the
particles of smoke land onto a persons clothing Thal person then comes home with
those smoke particles on their clothing and they can be shed when the clothes are
removed from their body thus placing the possible virus laden particles back into the
air at home to infect others. Just smell your clothes the next day and you can no
doubt smell smoke on them. Has this case in point been looked into as a possible
means of spreading the virus? Since a side eﬂ'ect of the virus is the patient
developing pneumonia would giving an elderly person the Preyar 13 shot help
strengthen their immune system before the virus ever strikes them?

I wish you &other virologist God Speed with ﬁnding a vaccine that will stop the
spread ofthis epidemic,

Hi Drt Fauci:

I have been a long time admirer of you in the ﬁeld of modern medicine,
This question I have relates to the current Coronavirus circulating
around the world. For many years 1 have informed people that the ways
a Virus can be passed from person to person isn’t always by a sneeze,
cough or by touching someones face with their hands. Has anyone in
your medical community thought that if someone were smoking and
was an infected person that once they expel the smoke particles into the
air that those micro smoke particles may contain Viruses that were in the
respiratory system of an infected person. Everyone I mention this to
don‘t believe that this is possible What are your thoughts on this
matter? If so why hasn’t the medical community warned the public
about this possibility as I stay away from all establishments that allow
smoking on their premises.

Thank you,

Subject: Question re: coronavirus infection &pneumococcal vaccination

Dear Dr. Fauci,
This is Manon Cox, former CEO of Protein Sciences, the developer of Flublok".

First ofall I would like to thank you for your realistic comments around the ongoing
coronavirus outbreak I am glad to see that not everyone is presenting a "Spanish Flu"e like
scenario.

I am reaching out to you b/c I an noticing that so many people including professionals
(MD’s!) appear to be thinking that people with a coronavirus infection are dying from a
cytokine storm whereas my understanding is that pneumonia (whether viral or bacterial) is
generally the underlying of the lung failure.

My question to you is: Do we know whether people that have previously received a
pneumococcal vaccination might be better protected from death after contracting a severe
coronavirus infection? Let. would it be possible that the coronavirus causes tissue damage
resulting in a secondary pneumococcal infection?

I know better than anyone (atte’ working over 15 years on Flublok approval) that it is not
realistic to expect a coronavims anytime soon but if we could message that a
pneumococcal vaccine could be beneficial in ultimate outcome it would be good for
vaccines in general as we do have pneumovax and Prevnar available.

Thank you for your consideration.

 

Kind regards, Manon Cox

Dear Dr Fauci,

America magazine is the ﬂagship effort of America Media in New York. We are a ministry
of the Jesuits of the United States and Canada America magazine may be the best known
Catholic publication in the United States, publish lor more than 100 years.

I realile you must be supremely busy under the circumstances, but I thought I would ask it
you could spare a few minutes for an interview in New York, over the phone or on remote
via Skype for one of our internet programs to talk about the coronavirus landfall here in
the United States, how the public can best respond. We would also love to hear how your
faith is helping you cope personally, perhaps how your Jesuit background is assisting your
decision-making in this drama.

Let me know it you think anything might be possible.
Thanks,
Kevin Clarke

Hi Tony.

It may not be as pertinent as it was when we submitted it, but I thought you might be interested in our
modeling on the global spread of COViD-IB, it is in press at PNAS.

We also have a paper submitted to them about ICU and ventilator inadequacy in the US, I'd be happy to
send it to you now or wait until after the peer-review process

Thank you for everything you do to lead usthrough these crises.

Dear Dr. Faucl,

I have been reading about your efforts to learn quickly about COViD-19. and subsequently educate the
American public about its risks. Iwanted to say how grateful I am for your expertise. perseverance and
candor.

Updates about what Americans should do to keep safe, and understanding what may be deemed risky
for personal and community health, are greatly needed in these days of information (and possibly
misinformation) overload, lelrlg American people current Information and clear. updated guidance Is
the best way to create yassroots, coordinated, widespread effort, while the CDC, NIH, and other
government health organizations organize the tops-down approaches to regional screening, emergency
care, and COVlD-19 research/testing for hopeful vaccination or treatment protocols.

I'm very relieved and assured to have strong voices of reason, experience, and merit helping 'us'
navigate these murky waters. I'm grateful for your courage.

Thank you again.

Hi Francis et :1, i write to get a message to Tony, who clearly is an the COVlDrlﬂ front lines of these days and
“everywhere," At this early stage, you may agreethnt it is possible that cuntainment and/or mitigation will not
completely solve the current pandemic Instead, effeciive treatment or amelioration of the waist complications is
necessary. In this spirit. I have an idea that was spurred by a letter ill Lancet last month authored by Al Benevolent
[attached]. in this communication they suigest that baricitinib (Oluminnnt; a JAKl/Z inhibitor registered by Lilly
for the treatment of rheulnamid arthritis). using 'n silica techniques, might be useful in the treatment advanced
COVID-l9 pneumonia/ARDS identiﬁed , Baricitinib could possibly blunt the cytokine storm seen in the most
severely affected patients via inhibition ofJAKl /2. but also decrease viral entry in ATZ pulmonary cells and
myncardial cells via inhibition of GAK and AAKI. [t is has a relatively short plasnn half-life and hence could be
more useful than Roche's tocilizumah/Actanra). Baricltinib has a good safety proﬁle although as a drug to treat
autoimmunity ii is formally contraindicated in paiients with infections. this could be Offset by treatment patients
with anti-Vitals such as Gilead's remdesivit, etc. Perhaps you folks have already thong“ wow/discussed its use but
ifnot I'd like a chance to chat abuul my additional thoughts. Thanlsl Bill

Subiect: Nursing homes are ground zero for COVIDIQ -- and what more we can do to save lives
in the pandemic

Dear Colleague,
Two weeks ago it was clear that COVlD—19 would become a pandemic, and, sadly it has.

Now the United States is in the acceleration Ehase and cases, clusters, and large outbreaks will occur in
many parts of the country.

| outline steps we can take to reduce the harms. The core concept to protect the most vulnerable. First,
restrict visits to nursing homes. All of us can play a part reducing inlections. Medically vulnerable people
can protect themselves by reducing social contacts, I’m not sure I‘d go quite as far as my good friend Bill
Schaffner and say they should become semi-hermits but that's certainly a helpful frame of reference.
Health care needs to get much safer, and ready to surge sarely. And we need to stop mass gatherings,
consider telework, ﬁgure out whether closing schools will help, and more.

Read what I‘ve posted about ground xero in the COVID-IS pandemic in the US here.

I’ve shared on Twitter if you’d like to disseminate.

We‘ll all be working together to protect as many people as quickly as possible.

Thank you,

Tom

Dear Dr. Fauci:

It occurred to me that if vimses contain an iron atom. perhaps a form of magnetic moatment might
stop or reduce the severity of the COVlD—19 virus, so I investigated and found that Viruses have one atom
of iron My suggestion is that experimentation on v ctims of the virus be conducted, perhaps by inserting
a tiny magnet into their lungs to sec if it might gather up the vimscs circulating in the victim, Perhaps
external application ofmagnetism would work as well, I'm sure your scientists will hate even better

Dear Dr Fauci,

I am embarrassed to admit that I was not familiar with your name when i read the story about you in
today's NV Times, but I was most impressed by the statement in the first sentence that you are "Widely
respected for [your] ability to explain science without talking down to [your] audience”.

I’m putting together the first offering of CLCH 300: Communicating Science, as part: of the University of
Pennsylvania‘s new online Certiﬁcate in Climate

Change. (httus://|nsonlinesasuvennedu academics/certificates climate—chanﬂe) A brief recorded
conversation with you about your strategies for communicating without being patronizing would be
most enlightening for my students.

The students in this course Will be coming from a wide variety of backgrounds, and potentially from all
over the globe. l think they would love to hear from a scientist who is so good at communicating his field
of study to different audiences. And let's face it, as soon as you say ”NIH" as COVID-IB swirls around the
globe, their ears will certainly perk up! lthinkthe students would find our interview very engaging and
informative.

The first run of the course will be from May 26 to July 20, 2020, but we can record the interview lonline)
any time, since Iknow you are already over-extended right now. I think 15 minutes would be plenty, and
I would be happy to send you questions that I plan to use to guide the conversation in advance. If a
synchronous conversation is impossible given yourschedule, I would be happy to just send you a couple
of questions and ask you to use them to guide a 1015 minute video that you record yourself,

Please let me know what you think of this, and I will send you the syllabus when it’s finalized, including
where our interview would fit. Then I can begin the process of coordinating this with the Associate
Director of our Online Learning Studio.

subject: can you use a mIRNA»seq assay to detect covtdals In blood samples?

Drl Fauci, how are you Sir?

Long ago, in the early 90’s, I was a post-doctoral fellow in the Laboratory of Viral and Molecular
Pathogenesis at NIH. I don’t know if the same lab is still there. Now | work on brain Injury and
Alxheimer’s but my interest in viruses and mechanisms of viral pathogenesis has not waned and the
recent David-19 outbreak prompted me to do a little investigation on my own.

My studies of blood microRNA changes atter TBI and AD suggest that principal component analysis of
distinct changes in circulating mIRNAs can identify the patient population. MicroRNA alterations can be
measured by real-time PCR which I presume is the basis of the testthat is developed for this disease but
I am analyling blood miRNA-seq expression profiles and now it is possible to quickly sequence blood
samples in a lew hours and get accurate results. Blood gene expression in my studies was more variable
(lots of RNases in blood) so Itound that microRNAs are much more stable in blood and serum samples.

I attach an example of a PCA/hierarchical clustering heatmap analysis ofa GEO dataset for MERs-coV
from 2016 hltDSIIIWWWanEblﬂlm.n|h-HUV/geolquerV/BCEIKI?3CC=GSE31852

I performed the PCA and heatmap analyses at two different stringencies and you can see that the
patients can be unequivocably distinguished from the controls at very significant p and FDR values.

Just a thought but many clinical centers, hospitals, academic institutions can quickly perform
transcriptome-wide sequencing. Blood RNA can be isolated in 1-2 hrs, sequencing libraries made in a
few hres and one miRNA sequencing run can handle up to 43 samples and the data can be quickly
analyzed.

Just my two cents on how NIH could accelerate the analysis of new blood samples for this new strain at
coronanvirus. Vou could mobilile hundreds of sequencing centers to help in the analysis.

Tony,

it‘s been so inspiring seeing you fight tirelessly against COV|D~19, sticking to the facts and stepping upto
explain on a daily basis

if there's anything I can do to help from the world of emergency medicine beyond patient care, please
let me know. Whether that means taking on a new project or pushing my specialty organization, the
American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). I sit on their board and keep looking for ideas to help
ﬁght this pandemic.

Subject: California DMV Coronavirus exposure danger

Dear Dr. Fauci.

I am writing to alert you to What I believe is a serious coronavirus health threat in California
that is being posed by the Calilomia Department of Motor Vehicles.

It has long been the policy ofthe California DMV that all drivers OVER 70 YEARS OLD must
renew theirorivers licenses IN PERSON at DMV ofﬁces,

DMV ofﬁces are notorious for being extremely crowded and requiring long wait times where people are
breathing on each other touching each other and undisinlected surfaces and touch screens for hours

As far as I am aware DMV ofﬁces are raver sanitized so germs from thousands of people can remain
there
tor weeks on and

This is obviously a dangerous environment tor anyone in the current worldwide coronavirus emergency
yet nobody in the news media is reporting on itor even seems aware of the danger.

In light oi your recent statement warning people over to so to avoid crowds this Caliiornia DMV policy
seems to be incredibly inesponsible and even life threatening but nobody is doing anything about it.

=. Only one day earlier on March 4 California Goveer Gavin

Newsom
declared a State of Emergency in California to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

[ﬁnd this situation to be utterly absurd since Newsom is allowing California citizens to be exposed to
exactly the kind of coronavims danger he claims to be preventing and apparently does not even know
that the DMV is totally contradicting his emergency declaration. the CDC recommendations. the
oaiiiornia State Health Department, the Los Angeles County Health Department. and the Pasadena City
Health Department.

. I am concerned that nobody seems to see
the obvious public health threat None of the relevant public health agencies have any information about
this

 

on their websites and the California DMV website makes N0 MENTION WHATSOEVER of Coronavirus
as a health threat in there overcrowded ofﬁces.

l would sincerely like to know what you make or this dangerous DMV policy. I also want to tell you that
the Californai DMV l5 currently advertis rig on the radio asking even more people to crowd DMV offices in
order to

gel the REAL lD license.

REAL ID furtherexacerbates the danger by drawmg in more than NINE MILLION Californians to
leave their germs in DMV ofﬁces over the next few months al the exact time we are in the midst of the
greatest health emergency of this century and the most important recommendation is to AVOID
CROWDS and stay at least six leet away from other people. Try staying six leet away from anyone In a
crowded DMV oflice where hundreds 0" people are stuffed in like sardines.

Obviously a rational policy would be to suspend the requirement for drivers over 70 to renew in person
and simply

let them renew by mail until the coronavirus emergency is over.

The same should be done for REAL ID. Alotal suspension to protect public heallh in a cri5ls is the only
sane thing to do.

lf I were the Director of the California DMV lwould close all offices immediately and dlsintect every inch
of them. and not reopen until the coronavirus emergency is over.

l would require that all DMV business snould be done by mail or internal until the coronavirus threat is
oven

Please tell me what you think about all this and I will forward your response to local Pasadena ofﬁcials
sinoe state level ofﬁcials are almost impossible to contact even in an emergency when they most need
to get this kind of inlormation from the public but apparently do not want to know about bad news.

l greatly appreciate your voice of reason in these scary times. l wish the ofﬁcials ol the State of
Calilornia

were as reasonable but they are apparently oblivious to a serious and unnecessary danger being
created by

one of thelr own state agencies.

Sincerely

Robert Maine_

Cocktail of ﬂu, HIV drugs appears to

help ﬁght coronavirus: Thai

doctorSm-Febmary 2, 2020

 

By Panu Wongcha-um

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai doctors have seen success in treating
severe cases of the new coronavirus with combination ofmedications for
ﬂu and HIV, with initial results showing vast improvement 48 hours
after applying the treatment, they said on Sunday

The doctors from Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok said a new approach in
coronavirus treatment had improved the condition of several patients
under their care, including one 70—year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan
who tested positive for the coronavirus for 10 days.

The drug treatment includes a mixture of anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and
ritonavir, in combination with ﬂu drug oseltamivir in large doses.

"This is not the cure. but the patient's condition has vastly improved.
From testing positive for 10 days under our care, after applying this
combination of medicine the test result became negative within 48
hours,“ Dr. Kriangska Atipornwanich) a lung specialist at Rajavithi,
told reporters

"The outlook is good but we still have to do more study to determine
that this can be a standard treatment."

Chinese health ofﬁcials have already been administering the HIV and ﬂu
drugs to ﬁght the coronavirus. The use of the three together in a cocktail
seemed to improve the treatment, the Thai doctors said.

Another doctor said that a similar approach in two other patients resulted
in one displaying some allergic reaction but the other showed
improvement.

"We have been following international practices, but the doctor
increased the dosage of one of the drugs," said Somsak Akkslim,
director-general of the Medical Services Department, referring to the ﬂu
medicine Oseltamivir.

Thailand has recorded 19 cases of coronaviius. Of the Thai patients,
eight have recovered and gone home while 1 1 are still under treatment in
hospitals.

 

Somsak said the health ministry will meet on Monday to discuss the
successful treatment in the case of the 70—year-old but said it is still too
soon to say that this approach can be applied to all cases.

Initially we will apply this approach only to severe cases," he said.

Mukesh Kumar

The cases at 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS—CuV—Z) iniection have been continuously increasing ever since its
outbreak in China last December. Curreniy, there are no approved drugs to treat the inreetion. In this scenario,
there is a need to utilize the existing repe1oire or FDA approved drugs to treat the disease. The rational
selection ot these drugs could he made by testing their ability to inhibit any SARS-CoV-2 proteins essential for
viral lite-cycle,

We chose one such crucial viral protein, the papam-like protease (PLpro), to screen the FDA approved drugs in
silico. The homology model at the protease was built based on the SARS-coronavirus PLprn structure. and the
dmgs were docked ln 83/84 pockets at the active site at the enzyme. In our docking studies, sixteen FDA
approved dmgs. including chloroquine and tormoteroi. was tound to bind the target enzyme with signiﬁcant
atﬁnity and good geometry. suggesting their potential to be utilized against the virus.

Tony, that part of the message was not directed at you. Peter Stalev and I have seen you in action on TV
and I’ve forced — to watch you talking about social distancing, since she
says the President says she has nothing to worry about. Bob Redfield and SecretaryAlar haven't been as
forthright as you have.

The main thing that concerns many people I know: the roll—out oi testing, surveillance has been botched
and we’re likely to have cases of COVlD in our communities already Without knowmg it. Meanwhile
some corporations, some universities, some other institutions have started to put social distancing into
place, with a few municipalities doing the same, but there is no real guidance from CDC on when to act
for most of us. There are plenty of instructions about getting prepared, but all seem to point towards
waiting until there is an outbreak in one's community to do anything substantial, which seems it you’ll
excuse my language, ass-backwards, as one you see multiple cases, you’re likely to already have
widespread community transmission.

I think this piece by Bill Hanage at Harvard explains where a lot of us are right now:

Dear Tony, Bob and Deb et al,

The AIDS experts among you know me well, We’ve been ﬁrst adversaries then colleagues for over 30
years.

They also know I can’t keep my mouth shut, which is a virtue and a failing, depending on the context.
Now:

There are thousands of people waiting for advice from our federal government on broader social
distancing measures in light of the fact that our lailure in early testing and surveillance means the
coronavirus IS likely already spreading m our communities.

If you thought the ire of AIDS activists 30 years ago was tough, the anger now spreading among
researchers, scientists, clinicians and activists is going to be a conflagration.

All we see is genuflection in word and deed from most of you to a White House that wants this all to
magically go away.

Yes, I know you're all doing your best and behind the scenes our federal government is hard at work. For
those I know, i don't doubt your commitment to public service.

But time is running out.

We need vocally, unequivocal leadership now, that offers real guidance to communities about what to
do, what might happen next.

Your own legacies will be deﬁned by this moment, what you do and what you don’t, what you shy away
from saylng because you fear for yourJohs or your shortAterm fortunes In the eyes of the Preswdent.
The status quo is untenable.

It's going to get people killed by this virus.

Subject: Stability data - spoke to Vincent.

Talked to Vincent. Attaching his manuscript, under review with NEJM. Vincent is available at-
- if you need him.

How the experiments were done:

Aerosol — A solution oi live virus was made and aerosolixed in a rotating drum (keeping it in aerosol
lorm); at various time points, air was removed and amount of Virus measured (using end-point titration
on Vero cells).

Surface — A base solutions of live virus was made and placed on specific surfaces (plastic, etc) and at
various time points, coating was taken away and virus contained was titrated.

Note that surface experiments with prateinaceous material leg, respiratory secretions] are underway,
as are variations in relative humidity and temperature.

How do you interpret aerosol data?

Decay in aerosols occurs over three hours, so if the virus is aerosoliled (via aerosolvgenerating
procedures or cough), the moment it drops below a certain threshold, it would be hard to get an
infectious dose/infection. Of course we do not actually know the infectious dose. which limits our ability
to give ﬁrm guidance based on this data.

 

How do you interpret the suriace stability data?

Copper seems to have some virucidal effect, as is seen with other viruses, Plastic and stalnless steel
don’t have much of an effect on the virus itsell, and the vlrus persists for some tlme. As for cardboard,
difficult to interpret because the surface absorbs a good deal, but there is some immediate decay.

Should we be concerned about packages based on your data?

This ls of far lower concern than droplet and otherfamlte transmlssinn, Tvplcal shipping Will allow ample
time for viral decay, and the cardboard itself seems to have some direct effect on the virus (either
through absorptlon or other effect]. for example, In the experlment, Vlrlcent applled

10eS viral pariicles/mL and it drops 2 logs to er3 immediately, indicating that either due to absorption
or dlred effect on the virus.

ortourse, lla mall Carriercoughs on a package and then someone touches it directly after, there may
be a risk. The tvplcal shlpping situation ls llkelv not a concern.

why are SARSCoVaz vs. SARSaCoVal different?
For the cardboard data in particular. there ls a dl'lerence seen between SARS-CoV-Z and 1, whlch ls
llkelv due to error/\lariaticn in surface.

Dear Dr Fauci,

i am copying below a letter Ijust sent to the editors of Lancet and NEJM that I thinkyou should
also read. it‘s informal as it is not meant for publication but just as a concern. Since I no longer
work as a virologist, I am formally out of the field. I am however active as chief psychiatrist in
Stockholm, Sweden. If you have doubts as to my expertise as a virologist or a physician, Dr
Bernard Roizman at U 0“: knows rre very well, as Markus Heilig does here in Sweden.

"I have noticed a striking difference in mortality by CoV-19 in different countries.
China and Italy have a mortality that's at least 6-fold higher than that in South Korea.
So far Germany and Scandinavia, totalling over 1300 cases. have not reponed a single
death. That's over a 35-40 fold difference.

Looking at the data more closely, l have found that China and Italy have been using
the antiviral Remdesivir (Gilead Sciences) extensively on many patients in intensive
care,justiﬁcd as "compassionate use". in the epidemic areas of ltaly this drug is now
part of treatment guidelines for hospitalised patients, used on every single patient in
"critical condition". (see attachment). The "rationale" is simply that the ﬁrst two cases
treated at the Spallanzani Hospital in Rome received this drug, and...well, actually
survived.

NIHmoam

 

Remdesivir has never passed a Phase 3 trial, but has already made big headlines in
major international newspapers. Neither South Korea nor Germany or Scandinavian
countries have yet used this drug

I understand that this is a (relatively) long shot, but given the number of lives at stake,
I would recommend that a carefully scrutiny by the scientiﬁc community on the use of
this drug is warranted.

l have no conﬂict of interest.

Thank you for your attention‘i

Subject BIO Corannvirus Collaboration Initiative March lZIli Summit -
POSTPONED

Dear Colleagues,

B10 is heartened that so many of you have expressed interest in
joining us for the BIO Coronavirus Collaboration Initiative Summit
planned for March 12, 2020. Given the evolving circumstances
surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, and after discussions with
our Board leadership, we have decided to postpone the BIO
Summit so that we can make adequate arrangements to hold the
meeting virtually. We made this decision out of an abundance of
caution, so as to avoid placing anyone at unnecessary risk of
exposure while we work together to improve our nation’s ability to
respond to this outbreak. We will re-scnedule this virtual meeting
within the next two weeks using a digital technology that can allow
for robust discussion among the participants.

In the interim, we plan to send out a short questionnaire on
Monday to all company participants requesting Information on your
product, technology or service, which we plan to compile in a
digital “book” and share with all participants in advance of the
meeting. We believe this approach will help to make the meeting
more efficient, allowing us to quickly shift to discussions of the

 

most important shared challenges and potential opportunities that
exist between industry members, government leaders and non-
government partners.

Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions. We will
move quickly to establish a new date for this meeting and
appreciate your ﬂexibility in this regard. We look forward to talking
with many of you then.

Thanks again for your commitment to enhancing the health and
safety of people facing this outbreak around the globe.

Sincerely,

Tony--

It has been awhile since we have worked together since my lime
as the senior SES standing up DTRA (with the help of Josh
Lederberg M.D. &Dave Franz DVM who you know), at
Argonne/Uchhicago establishing your NIAID RBL with Olaf
Schneewind MD, and as the DHS Director of Research
reporting to SEC Michael Chertoff &UIS Jay Cohen (RADM-

ret). Michael &Jay brought me aboard when Jay was our Chief of
Naval Research at ONR and I was ONR‘s Executive Director
&Chief Sdentist. I know you have your hands very iull with the

 

COVlD-19 threat, so I wanted to give you a heads up that a
game changer for enhanced detection of COVlD-19 has
emerged. Thanks to DARPA &DHS S&T sponsorship in years
past olANDE developing a real time Rapid DNA microﬂuidics
system for human Identiﬁcation, the ANDE group has a
breakthrough for detection of COVID-19 and to the future, other
emerging threat viruses.

As you may know the ANDE system for human identiﬁcation (eg.
CT &DHS missions) is mature and now deployed
operationally/tactically by CENTCOM, DIA, the IC and used most
recently by DHS in their recent test bed in El Paso to
demonstrate its effective capabilities to determine family
relationship in undocumented minors. Additionally ANDE is in
use by law enforcement and by ofﬁcials responding to mass
casualty events (CA 2018 Camp Fire disaster, 2019 Conception
dive boal fire, and the very recent 2020 tragic helicopter crash) to
ID the victims.

The ANDE system now provides 2 hour turnaround with no
special training requirements as a stand—alone system for all the
above users. Our warﬁghters and special operators are using
the ANDE system now in ﬁeld forward operations and it meets
MIL specs &is the only system certiﬁed for data submission to the
DoD ABIS/DIA DNA repository and FBI CODIS data base. The

executive summary and a more in—depth document for your
teams review. Hope the above is helpful and I stand ready to
provide any additional information. l have oc'd Jim Davis (ANDE

since we have worked together I have attached my bio and that

Subject: Ems Personnel &Amhulance Teams

Dear Dr. Fauci:

Im a ﬁrst responder, and I believe an oral vaccine platform is the best

delivery method for situations of national emergency like the
COIOI'IZVH'US‘

It'the vaccine is a tablet, we would be able to keep them on our
ambulances and get medical authorization whenever the situation arises.
First responders can then treat patients before doctors and nurses and
also instead of having the patient make an appointment 0r having them
wait in line for a shot, which can ultimately cause more spread.

This method that will enable the EMS teams ofthe nation to combat
outbreaks because you would allow EMT (Emergency Medical
'l‘echnicrans) and Paramedics to diffuse situations through our
Ambulances. This will iead to more control and get a hold of the
situations as fast as possible and lower the spread of the virus on our
people.

Thank you.

Dear Sir,

I am sending this message to ass' 1 in an idea to help minimiLe the impact of
Coronavirus, Instead of people going to the hospital or urgent care. Each county
health department needs to have a direct number of a national number that
distributes information to local county government health department. If you are
sick and show or exhibit signs of the coronavirus you should call the appropriate
number, a technician will come to your home, draw lab specimen needed. Of course
ifsomeone is extremely ill they should call 91 l and advise 91 1 they are exhibiting
signs of the virus. There should be special protocols in place for how to transport the
patient into the hospital as Well ( to limit exposure to everyone involved. This means
ﬁnding alternative entrance at hospitals for a suspected coronavirus patients These
patients should be brought in by a least used location of the hospital into a special
unit that has a barrier from the rest of the emergency department

Home lab work will keep someone from sitting in a waiting room for 37 5 hours.
The county unit to conduct lab work will act in response much like calling 91] or
the police. Each hospital neeck to set up an emergency entrance for Coronavirus
patients only, and the unit must be sealed from the remainder ofthe unit. We begin
having a coronavirus team that does not cross contaminate to any other unit on the
emergency room ﬂoor. lam thinking ofthe best plausible way to minimize
outbreak. This helps.

Dear Tony

A note to let you know how much over the years I have appreciated your
active support of biologic research, public health and your directorship of
NIAID. Impressive, intelligent, high integrity and management skills has
placed you at the head of the curve. I reached this conclusion from
personal observations of your work and style as well as having served as a
consultant for NIAID and several other NIH Institutions, WHO, Pasteur and
Karolinska,

After nearly 50 years of continuous research from my original A|09484
grant studying viral pathogenesis[ acute and persistent infections] using the
LCMV model, I decided to close my laboratory. I have had other generous
NIH support as well especially for investigations of other negative strand
viruses[ primarily measles and influenza, Lassa ,arenavirus receptor],
Ebola, cytokine storm and autoimmunity The A|09484 grant was credited
by 300 peer reviewed papers, training of 61 postdoctoral fellows[ including
Rafi Ahmed, Christine Biron, Persephone Borrow, Ray Welsh, Ian Lipkin,
Dorian McGavern and other successes including the late Patrick Sissons
who was the Reagent Professor of Medicine at Cambridge, Over 85% of
these folk are in academic medicine/biology at research institutes or
universities.

Good luck and smooth sailing with the current coronavirus pandemic. With
your involvement this work is in good hands.

Best wishes
Michael

Subject: Corona Virus planning
Dear Dr. Fauci;

I am a toxicologist and have spent time, years ago, working in the arena of oncogenic
virology as part of NCI programs. I am very concerned about what I see in the news
media about the NIH approach to the COVID-19 pandemic (yes, pandemic) that has
arrived in our country. There is much talk about development of a vaccine, however. I
believe that this is a long-term strategy. You and I both know, from working as
scientists. that the development and trial of an antiviral vaccine is a months-long
program, at best. I am surprised, even disappointed, that there seems to be no visible
focus on the part of the NIH on the development of anti-viral treatments (drugs etc) . It is

my professional opinion that anti-virals would take a shorter time to develop than
vaccines, yet it appears that this may be a back burner focus of NIH.

I realize that there are many political pressures on your ofﬁce and | support your strong
efforts to apply science to the resolution of this growing problem. Please do not give
short shrift to the potential of antiviral treatments in favor of the longer-term promise of a
vaccine.

Respectfully yours,

Dear Scott,

How are you? It was a great pleasure talking with you on Wechat, As we discussed, I have a
friend who works in Wandfo Biotech Company in Guangzhou (a public listing company)
They have developed a One Step COVIDIS test kit to screen the Corona Vitus in only 15
minutes This test kit is been massively used in China and it's been supplied to Japan,South
Korea, Ukraine and Iran to cope with the Corona Virus, it has also been certified by Chinese
health organization and EU. I am wondering if you have any connection with any medical
organizations, if they need this kit, Wondfo is able to supply, —
—, Wondfo provide international shipping worldwide Maybe this can be helpful
for some people.

It seems COVIDrlB causes greater problems for the elderly and those with chronic illnesses] as you have
said

Why not try giving those with active disease, or those at risk, gamma—globulin, to ameliorate the effects
ofthe illness?

It would be especially interesting to prepare batches of gamma globulin using the blood 12.00% 3,000
donors) of people who have, or who have recovered irom,COVID-13 infection.

There isample precedent for using Gamma-globulin to prevent or treat viral illnesses [Hepatitis A, B) or
diseases or unknown etiology (ie Kawasaki's).

This could be useful especially while we wait for the development of a vaccine.

What do you think?

Subject: From ER Provider. Some Common sense COVlD-l9 add]. suggestions

Dr. Fauci:
I have been following you and others on CSPAN with appreciation.
1) Please ensure you are all getting adequate sleept

(There is too much yahoo-machismo in our field) Please put forth
recommendations for providers and their employers.
2) I see the CDC warning about herbals, which I agree with except for one:
echinacea, just about the only herbal With proven medical usefulness, not as it is

recommended on the bottles or websites, but as only a single 2 capsules, on day
one ofviral illness. Echinacea demarginates the matured bone marrow leukocytes.
Used as a "one shot deal"

may decrease COVlD-19 duration/severity as eg; "take right away on day one,
drink plenty of water and sleep as long as necessary",

Please at least study the use of Echinacea in this manner for COVID-19. (Google is
suddenly missing Echinacea's mechanism/use info, so please have this corrected, if
for nothing else to prevent hoarding. One bottle can be for a whole neighborhood
and please ask the drug stores to offer "two packs" with proper instructions.

eg.: "take only two as soon as i” with cold or flu and not take more, but to
replenish the immune system follow up With fresh fruits and vegetables, etc.

3) Make sure we have enough Ventolin, Proventil available so those with new
asthmatic component due to COVID»19 can call their Dr. for RX if they cannot blow
out a match, for

instance, and use the drive through instead of goin into the pharmacy. Consider
hazmat for drive through testing and Rx pharmacy staff (as in S. Korea). I would be
interested in knowing the percent of COVlDelS respiratory sufferers who can stay
home but will need Ventolin. 10%? (just a guess from seeing bronchitis in the ER).

 

4) Ensure all the medical providers with ofﬁces, give out their office telephone
numbers and have staff trained to triage calls so people can stay home until they
are well,
5) Ensure levothyroxine (the US most common Rx) is made in the USA from
ingredients made in the USA. Ditto for down the line of the most necessary and
common RX, including Ventolin, and the antibiotics that would treat bacterial
superinfection of COVID-lS lpa rticularly the ones that can be used at home:
macrolides, etc.)
6) Encourage prevention of superinfection with clean respiratorytoilet, hydration,
chest PT preferred over suctioning, clean environment, including cleaning ﬂoors
daily. One ofthe most successful methods of chest PT involves the patient lyingon
the bed with their face near the floor. Decreasingthe load of uulmonarv sputum is
critical.
7) There is very large numberofsemirretired physicians, such as myself who would
probably like to be utilized (an paid a little) for telemedicine to assist with triage.
We can do telemedicine at home. lam not set up to do this but will soon be set
up and able. We need to know which companies we can trust to hire us.
There should be telemedicine training and tracking coming from the CDC or
other state and national governments
8) ls the 3/3/20 John Kehoe Financial Times article correct? Is it not best to predict
mortality so as to more realistically prepare for post-COVlD—IS recovery
economically and socially and give confidence by being transparent?
I see recovery jobs being the young taking care of the old after most have had it
and been cured or succumbed. Then the other half of the people will get it, too. .
Is there some stigma attached to the word "infrastructure" that would prevent
recovery of our economy?
9) I do not wee the recommendations for Flu and both pneumovax vaccines, but
the recommendation needs to get out broadly right away,
10) Wuhan had to truck in foods..how are we planning? Canned food decreases
one's immune system, Fresh lruits and vegetables, frozen or dried are needed.
11) China closed all the theaters...and we should also start closing the use of public
places, particularly asking folks in their 60's and older to stay home now.
12) Recommend providers write three month supply of Rx for all patients,
to decrease visits out and ensure availability.
13) The closure of schools might spread COVIDrlQ unless children have food to eat
at home and the parents comply.
14) Will census takers spread it? Should the census be postponed or performed via
hazmat suit or in another fashion?
This is a long list Please look nto Zapacks of Echinacea with instructions
Get enough sleep/stay well.
Thank you.

Subject: Covid-19 Pandemic — update

Dear Tony:

As I continue to follow the evolution of this disastrous calamity, I
continue to think of possible approaches to dealing with therapeutic
options that might be ”off the beaten trail" but nonetheless worth
considering — especially for those patients who are at high risk for
debilitation and. possibly. death. I share one such thought with you
here,

Several years ago, recombinant Human Growth Hormone [rHGH]
was reported to be significantly effective in restoring/enhancing T
cell anti-viral activity in patients infected with HIV [citation below]:

Growth hormone resurrects adult human
thymus during HIV-1 infection

Kiki Tesselaar, Frank Miedema
J Clin Invest, 2008;1l8(3)2844-847i hugsd/doLorgﬂOJ 172/1035] 12.

My thought is that since, in many ways, elderly patients afﬂicted
with COVlD-19 fall into a similar category, that treatment with

 

rHGH might be an effective treatment alternative to employ during
this immediate time frame while you are exploring more speciﬁc
alternatives.

1 look forward to your thoughts on this, and best wishes.

Subject: university coronavirus

Hello and thank you for all of your tireless efforts in dealing with the coronavirus.

I have a concern about the uriversities and the spread ofthls virus. Many schools
brought back students from study abroad before the 14 day quarantine was put
into place, and even after the quarantine was put in place, many students did not
follow the quarantine rules. Also. with shared dorms and apartments lt was not
possible for student's who returned to campuses and not their homes. By the times
schools came up with a plan for quarantinlng the students it was well over a week
after some were back. Therefore, there is potential for widespread infection.

The vice president said the elderly and those Wlth underlying medical conditions
are at risk and should take caution in where they go. avoid crowded places
etc..Mll|ions of students have asthma, diabetes, auto-immune disorders, and they
do not have a choice other than to go to class. The government does not seemed
concerned about the potential spread among campuses and what a disaster this
could be. They have voiced why grade schools are not closed (since younger are
not at risks better for them to be at school) but they are ignoring college kids are
at risk and the impact ofw'ldespread infection on a campus could be huge.
Students irfnnculleges travel back and forth to the city all the time, and i am
concerned schools are not temporarily closing until more testing is available and
we see where this goes. At minimum, giving student‘s with underlying medical
conditions the option to go home and work remotelyt Right now they do not have

NIHoooam

 

any option other than to go to class‘ When questioned they say they are listening
to the CDC and state government. —
and students are not following the advice to stay home sick and nobody seems
concerned about trying to prevent infection.

Can the government please look at a temporary ban on classes at Universities in
states where infection is rapidly spreading, especially knowing there are not
enough test available yet. The schools are not taking action on their own and this is
a frustrating situation seeing delays in decisions making,

Thank you for your time in consideration in addressing these concerns,

I appreciate the efforts of the WHO taking a look into

data. for example. I was wondering if it would be

WHO‘s biosiatisticians know what they are doing. but
data is a funny thing. You get the answers to the
questions you ask. if the right questions were not
asked, you may miss useful information.

Regarding the subject line. it the theory is true that
children have some cross-reactive protection due to
antibody production to the harmless coronavirus
population, that would mean that pediatricians would
also carry very high levels of protective antibody. If
this is tme, then piasmapheresis might provide anti-
ooronavirus antibody as potential treatment. I do not

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you for your leadership and guidance in this
difﬁcult time. I am a pediatrician in Massachusetts,
and as you know, direct-linkage from travel cases are
popping up on the East Coast. In order to keep the
community viral load down, keeping new cases from
moving around the country and the world will delay
the spread and ampliﬁcation of the viral

load. According to my observations, hot climates
seem to be having a favorable new case rate. Based
on the city of Qom versus the experience in
Singapore and Australia, it appears that the transition
temperature for efﬁctent spread is somewhere above
when there are highs around 50 degrees F, similar to
H1 N1. According to my observations, prior to
seasonal ﬂu, the transition temperature was closer to
highs of 40 degrees F. This theory should be
testable, For example. there are new cases in Kuwait
and Bahraint If I am right. if you tested a subset of
these populations, you would ﬁnd a very high rate of
asymptomatic infection, probably 80-90%, because
that's how many people It would take to shed small
amounts of virus to create a community viral load to
make someone sick enough to get tested If this is
true, this bodes well for the virus burning itself out to
endemic status relatively quickly This would be very
reassuring data you could provide to reduce panic - if
you can tell people you know how long this pandemic
is going to last rather than saying that we don't know,

Although some experts may say that restricting travel
will only delay the ineVitable. this is not a valid
statement if the transition temperature for effect
spread really is 50 degrees, A delay of signiﬁcant
community spread in the US until highs reach the 50s
for the Northeast where the population is the most

 

dense would have a masswe life-saying effect, but if
this is to occur, the flight restriction needs to happen
now

Stopping all ﬂights would be impractical and
inhumane, but allowing return flights only and
stopping all other airtravel would be effective. It
would have a massive effect on the economy, but so
will overwhelming corona virus infection. No one will
die because they can't take a vacation or business
trip. FinanCial losses would need to be settled later,
so this would require emergency declarations, etc. lf
you wanted to take it in a step-wise manner, you
could start with international flights and then move on
to domestic flights if necessary - this would probably
be Wise and would have a less severe impact on the
economy.

Thank you again. and lam sure this is one of
thousands of unsolicited emails. I wish you the very
best and God grant you Wisdom.

Dear Bob,

Long time, no see. Our SARS study (JID 2006, 193:1244-1249; see the
attachment) showed selective expansions of Vv9V62 T cells in survivors of
SARS-00V infection, Interestingly, stimulated Vv9V62 T cells also display
an interferon-v—dependent anti-SARS-COV activity and are able to directly kill
SARS-CoV-infected cells. Since it is very easy to activate human Vy9V62 T
cells in vivo (e.g., using FDA-approved and relatively non-toxic drugs for
treating bone—demineralization) and given the similarities between SARS-
CoV and SARS-CoVQ, I thought that it could be potentially useful to bring
these facts to your and Tony's attention, in spite ot knowing that both of you

All the best and good luck with everything,

Subject: Pneumococcus vactinntion in relation to coronavirus infection.

Dear Anthony Fauci.

As I understand the fatal cases ofeovid-l‘) develop pneumonia after several days of
symptoms of the acute viral infection

In this way the present coneravirus infection is very like our present and previous
fatal inﬂuenza virus infections In the 1918 pandemic many ifnol most ofthe fatal
cases were caused by bacterial superinfection with hemolytic streptococci and
pneumococci, The former is rather seldom now, but the pneumococcal infections are
common

Should we advice persons over >65 y as well as people with chronic diseases with
increased risk of fatal eoronmirus diseases to be vaccinated against pneumocoeei
now?

My best regards and thank you for your signiﬁcant contribution to inﬂammatory
medicine and infections.

Dear Dr. Fauci,
l am so happy to continue seeing you in press conferences and on news broadcasts.

Please keep making those public appearances. Americans need to hear the facts from someone who is
trustworthy.

lam sure that tiptoeing around Donald Trump has dramatically complicated your life. I hope that you
will find ways to "correct” or “clariW’ the constant stream of misstatements that he makes— our lives
depend upon it. (Maybe Trump could wear a hazmat suit —to protect his fragile ego from any possible
bruising caused by a collision with the truth. Just kidding.)

Seriously, Doctor, it is a huge relief to see and hear you and your expert colleagues. It is to the point that
we cannot believe a single word that comes out of Trump’s mouth.

Very sincerely,
Elizabeth Stevens

Subject: A vacclne with anti Immunosuapresslve properties
Importance: Low

Dear Dr Fauci,

Common wisdom tells us that the inability to immunize against HIV, malaria etc. as well
as the need to

repeat evry year anti flu vaccination result from the excessive, or limitless, genetic
variability of the underlying pathogens, While not doubting the reality of this genetic
variability, best observed in an orderly manner in the case of HIV, I considered the
possibility that these pathogens are endowed wiith an immunosuppressive capacity
that is not inactivated during vaccine production, and that current vaccines do not
induce immunity against such

immunosuppression. I applied this reasonning when lworked on an AIDS vaccine in
1991 in Zagury‘s lab

(Halbrelch A et al. (1992) Vaccrne Research,4 1397-412). Indeed, we tested then, In
suitably immunized animals. the effect of the various preparations on the cellular
response to tuberculin and the capacity of animals to be

Immunized against tuberculin and tetanus as a function of the exrent of treatment. The
immune response to these agents was indeed higher in the presence of hivions

compared to heat inactivated preparations. This HIVION preparation was used on 6

patients in Zaire (Zagury et al. (1992) J Acquired Immune Deﬁciency Syndromes,
5 :676-681).

 

Unfortunately, when I tried to make a greater prep for a phase I trial, the viral preparation
turned out (too late),

by $08 gel elecrophoresis. not to contain any viral protein, due either to degradation or
another mishap. I left ZagurYs lab soon aﬂer and it was impossible for me later to obtain
material (either viral or from recombinant protein) to further advance the matter, I do

believe that tuning vaccine prepaation to counter immunosuppressive effect of the virus
(parasite) while preserving its capacity to induce anti viral immunity should resolve the
need to revaccinate every year against the same vims. In fact, identifying the épitopes,
acting for immunity and these
acting against immunosuppression, at a later stage should allow a better result than we
obtained. (It is not yet known whether corona vlrus also mutates rapidly, but I heard that
a woman was reinfected after having recovered from covid-19 intection and this might
indicate a capacity of the vims to counteract the host‘s immune response.

In — I have been Itching ever since to go back to
unﬁnished projects. butdid not

The conference, which ran from Feb. 28—March 2, drew
18,000 activists to Washington.

The AIPAC statement posted late Friday on Twitter said the
two people who tested positive are from New York. The
outbreak has been especially hard on the Orthodox Jewish
community in Westchester County, and AIPAC listed the
county’s health department as among the authorities with
which it is in communication.

The others are the New York Health Department, national
health authorities and the District of Columbia Health
Department. The statement also said the lobby was
consulting with Edward Septimus, a professor of internal
medicine at Texas A&M University.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I saw that you are discussing the steps we need to take to make the impact of
COVlD-19 a minimum in CNN and decided to write to you what we did as faculty in
this aspect

I believe that prevention is chh more important than treatment later. As a
preparation for the COVlD-19 outbreak, two days ago, I made a personal decision
to make all my homework on ine submission so that we may avoid the spread of
the virus anymore.

Students work on homework for hours and can easily spread the virus without
knowing it. Once it goes to graders (my TAs) , they then spread it to the rest of the
class, again without knowing it, Thus, an innocent act can be devastating. So, in
simply two—three days it may spread to another 100 new individuals easily.
Graders may act as hubs in this case. The dangeris, it may have spread to another
hundred or more new individuals even before it comes to a detectable level from
any test.

I also want to emphasis the following points:

1. We hear in all news that elderly people are the most vulnerable. But I think
it should be corrected as people with immunodeﬁciency are the most
vulnerable and elderly are in that category Some one who is 10 years old
and have diabetic or HIV has the same danger as an elderly person.

. We should come up with a test such as a pregnancy test, which can be done
at home without leaving their homes. This stops further spreading.

. We should discuss foods that help cure it fast and things that we should not
do

 

i have shared my thoughts with CNN (Dr‘ Sanjay Gupta and Anderson Cooper as
well), Thank you for your time and everything you do to our community at this
critical moment.

Best,

Udita

Our current understanding of COVID-lB mortality is that it appears to be concentrated in the elderly and

severe illness. Currently there are tens ofthousands of individuals WhO have been identiﬁed as having been
infected but are considered ’recovered'. That being case it would seem plausible that they have mounted an
antibody response to the virus.

The question is whether these individuals are being tested for antibody titre to the virus, and if that is
ucmrring whether they are being approached to donate plasma to move into lglv production. with this
illness still in its early stages and being international, I would imagine that such an ellart would involve a
public/private sector endeavor. Understanding the difﬁculty in developing a vactine for ’cold viruses'l |v|G
may be a way to at least reducethe mortality in our most vulnerable patients. 50, the slow start we have had
in testing the US population lor this virus goes beyond disease prevention - it would certalnly be affecting our
ability, to some degree, at rapidly developing a more targeted intervention for high risk patients.

Inside China’s All-Out War on the Coronavirus

Dr. Bruce Avlward, of the W.H.Ol, got a rare glimpse into Beijing's mmpaign to stop the epidemic. Here’s
what he saw,

By Donald G. McNeIIJr.

o March 4, 2020
As the leader ofthe World Health Organilation team that visited China, Dr. Bruce Aylward feels he has
been to the mountainto — and has seen what‘s possible.
During a two-week vis in early February, Dr. Aylward saw how China rapidly suppressed the
coronavirus outbreak that had engulfed Wuhan, and was threatening the rest ofthe country.
New cases in China have dropped to about 200 a day, from more than 3,000 in early February. The
numbers may rise again as China’s economy begins to revive. But for now, iar more new cases are
appearing elsewhere In the world.
China’s counterattack can be replicated, Dr. Aylward said, but it will require speed, money. imagination
and political courage.
For countries that act quickly, containment is still possible ”because we don‘t have a global pandemic —
we have outbreaks occurring globally,” he added.

NIH-M0915

 

Dr. Aylward, who has so years experience in ﬁghting polio, Ebola and other glubal health emergencies,
detailed in an interview With The New York Times how he thinks the campaign against the virus should
be run.

This conversatiun has been edited and condensed.

Do we know what this virus‘s lethality is? We hear some estimates that it’s close to the 1918 Spanish
flu, which killed 2.5 percent of its victims, and others that it's a little worse than the seasonal ﬂu,
which kills only 0.1 percent. How many cases are missed affects that.

There's this big panic in the West over asymptomatic cases Many peuple are asymptomatic when
tested, but develop symptoms Within a day or two.

In Guangdong, they went back and retested 320,000 samples originally taken for iniluenxa surveillance
and other screening Less than 0.5 percent came up positive, which is about the same number as the
1,500 known Covid cases in the province. (Covid-IB is the medicalname 0/ the illness caused by the
coronavirus)

There is no evidence that we’re seeing only the tip of a grand Iceberg, with ninetenths of it made up of
hidden zombies shedding virus. What we're seeing is a pyramid: most or it is abuvegruund

Once we can test antibodies in a bunch of people, maybe I’ll be saying, “Guess what? Those data didn’t
tell us the story.” But the data we have now don't support it,

That‘s good. il there's little asymptomatic transmission. But it’s bad in that it implies that the death
rates we‘ve seen — trom 0.7 percent In parts of China to 5.8 percent In Wuhan — are correct, right?
I’ve heard it said that "the mortality rate is not so bad because there are actually way more mild cases ”
Sorry — the same number of people that were dying, still die. The real case Fatality rate is probably what
it is outside Huhei Provinra, somewhert> between 1 and 2 pertent.

What about children? We know they are rarely hospitalized. But do they get infected? Do they iniect
their families?

We don‘t know That Guangdong survey also turned up almost no one under 20‘ Kids got flu, but not
this. We have to do more studies to see it they get it and aren’t affected, and iithey pass it to ierniiy
members, But I asked dozens of doctors: Have you seen a chain of transmission where a child was the
index Ease> The answer was no.

Why? There's a theory that youngsters get the four known mild caronauiruses so often that they're
protected.

That’s still a theory. I couldn’t get enough people to agree to put it in the Who. regort.

Does that imply that closing schools is pointless?

No. That’s still a question mark If a disease is dangerous. and you see tiiisters, you have to close
schools, We know that causes problems, because as soon as you send kids home, half your work force
has to slay home to la ke Late of lllElYL Bul yuu don't take LhdnLes with Lllildren.

Are the cases in China really going down?

I know there's suspicion, but at every testing clinic we went to, people would say, “le not like it was
three weeks ago.” It peaked 3146,000 people asking for tests a day; when we lelt, it was 13,000.
Hospitals had empty beds

Ididn’t see anything that suggested manipulation of numbers. A rapidly escalating outbreak has
plateaued, and come down faster than would have been expected. Back of the envelope, it’s hundreds
of thousands or people in china that did not get CnVide‘l‘) herause oi this aggressive response

Is the Virus infecting almost everyone, as you would expect a novel flu to?

ND — 75 LL) 80 percent of all clusters are in families You get the odd ones in hospitals or restaurants or
prisons, but the vast majority are in families. And only 5 to 15 percent of your close contacts develop
disease So they try to isolate you from your relatives as quickly as possible, and find everyone you had
contact with in 48 hours before that

You sald different cltles responded differently. How?

It depended on whether they had zero cases, sporadic ones, clusters or widespread transmission.

First, you have to make sure everyone knows the basics: hand-washing, masks, not shaking hands, what
the symptoms are. Then, to find sporadic tases, they do fever checks everywhere, even stopping tars on
highways to check everyone.

As soon as you find clusters, you shut schools, theaters, restaurants. Only Wuhan and the Cilies near it
went into total lockdown.

How dld the Chinese reorganlxe thelr medical response?

First, they moved 50 percent of all medical care online so people didn’t come in. Have you ever tried to
reach your doctor on Friday night? instead, you contacted one online If you needed prescriptions like
insulin or heart meditations, they could prescribe and deliver it

But If you thought you had coronavirus?

You would be sent to a fever clinic. They would take your temperature, your symptoms, medical history,
ask where you'd traveled, your Contact with anyone infected. They/d whip you through a CT scan
Wait — "whip you through a CT scan"?

Each machine did maybe 200 a day. Five, 10 minutes a scan. Maybe even partial scans, A typical hospital
in the West does one or two an hour. And not X-rays; they LUuId wine up normal, but a CT would show
the "groundrglass opacltles” they were looking for.

(Dr. Aylward was referring ra lung abnormalities seen in coronavirus patients )

And then?

If you were still a suspect case, you’d get swabbed. But a lot would be told. ”Vou’re not Covid.” People
would come in with colds, ilu, runny noses. That’s not Cor/id. if you look at the symptoms, so percent
have fever, 70 percent have dry coughs. 30 percent have malaise, trouble breathing. Runny noses were
only 4 percent.

The swab was for a PCR lest. right? How last could they do that? Until recently. we were sending all of
ours to Atlanta.

They got it down to four hours.

So people weren't sent home?

No, they had to wait. You don’t want someone wandering around spreading virus.

If they were posltlve, what happened?

They’d he isolared In Wuhan, in rhe beginning, it was 15 days from getting «km hospiralirarion They
got it down to two days from symptoms to isolation. That meant a lot fewer infected 7 you choke off
this thing‘s ability to lind susceptibles

What's the diﬁerence between isolation and hospitalixatlon?

 

NIH Production to ICAN_001343

 

(ECMOs are extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines, which axygenate the blood when the
Iungsfail.)

Who paid for all of this?

The government made it clear: testing is free. And if it was Covid719, when your insurance ended, the
state picked up everything.

In the U.S., that’s a barrier to speed. People think: “lfl see my doctor, it’s going to cost me $100. If I end
up in the I.C.U., what’s it going to cost me?” That’ll kill you. That‘s what could wreak havoc. This is where
universal health care coverage and security intersect. The US. has to think this through.

what about the nonmedical response?

It was nationwide. There was this tremendous sense of. ”We've got to help Wuhan,” not “Wuhan got us
into this." Other provinces sent A0300 medical workers, many of whom volunteered.

In Wuhan, our special train pulled in at night, and it was the saddest thing — the big intercity trains roar
right through, with the blinds down.

We got ofl, and another group did. I said, "Hang on a minute, I thought we were the only ones allowed
to get off.” They had these llttle Jackets and a flag —- It was a medical team from Guangdong coming In
to help.

How did people in Wuhan eat il they had to stay indoors?

Fifteen million people had to order food online. It was delivered. Yes, there were some screw-ups. But
one woman said to me: "Every now and again there’s something missmg from a package, but I haven’t
lost any weight.”

lots of government employees were reassigned?

From all over society. A highway worker might take temperatures, deliver food or become a contact
tracer, In one hospital, I met the woman teaching people how to gown up. l asked, "You’re the infection
control expert?“ No, she was a receptionist. She’d learned.

 

How did technology play a role?

They’re managing massive amounts of data, because they're trying to trace every Contact of 70,000
cases. When they closed the schools, really, just the buildings closed. The schooling moved online.
Contact tracers had onrscreen forms. If you made a mistake, it flashed yellow. It was idiotrproof.

We went to Sichuan, which is vast but rural. They'd rolled out 56. We were in the capital, at an
emergency center with huge screens. They had a problem understanding one cluster. On one screen,
they got the county headquarters. Stiil didn't solve it.

So they got the ﬁeld team. Here’s this poor team leader 500 kilometers away, and he gets a video call on
his phone, and it’s the governor,

What about social media?

They had Weibo and Tencent and WeChat giving out accurate information to all users Vou could have
Facebook and Twitter and instagram do that,

Isn't all of this impossible in America?

Look, journalists are always saying: "Weil, we can’t do this in our country." There has [0 be a shift in
mind-set to rapid response thinklng. Are you lust golng to throw up your hands? There’s a reai moral
hazard in that, a judgment call on what you think of your vulnerable populations,

Ask yourself: Can you do the easy stuff? Can you isolate 100 patients? Can you trace 1,000 contacts? If
you don’t, this will roar through a community.

Isn‘t it possible only because China is an autocracv?

Journalists also say, ”Well, they’re only acting out of fear of the government," as it it’s some evil the
breathing regime that eats babies. I talked to lots of people outSide the system 7 in hotels, on trains, in
the streets at night.

They’re mobilized, Ilke in a war, and it’s fear of the virus that was driving them. They really saw
themselves as on the front lines of protecting the rest of China. And the world.

Chlna ls restarting Its economy now. How can it do that wlthout creating a new wave of infections?
It’s a ”phased restart." It means ditierent things in different provinces.

Some are keeping schools closed longer. Some are only letting factories that make things crucial to the
Supply chain open. For migrant workers who went home 7 well, Chengdu has 5 million migrant
workers,

First, you have to see a doctor and get a certificate that you‘re ”no risk." It's guod forthree days.

Then you take the train to where you work. If it’s Beijing, you then have to self-quarantine for two
weeks. your temperature is monitored, sometimes by phone, sometimes by physical check,

What's going on with the treatment clinical trials?

They’re double-blind trials, so I don't know the results. We Should know more in a couple of weeks.
The biggest challenge was enrolling people The number of severe patients is dropping, and there's
competition for them. And every ward Is run by a team from another prnvlnce. so you have to negotiate
with Eadl one, make sure they're doing the protocols right.

And there are 200 trials registered 7 too many I told them: "You‘ve got to prioritize things that have
promising antiviral properties."

And they/re testing traditional medicines?

Yes, but It’s a few standard formulations. It's not some guy sitting at the end ofthe bed cooking up
herbs. They think they have some feverrreducing or antlrinllammatory properties. Not anthirals, but ‘it
makes people feel better because met/re used to it.

What did you do to protect Vourself?

A heap of hand sanitizer. We wore masks, because it was government policy. We didn't meet patients
or contacts of patients or go into hospital Llirty zones

And we were socially distant. We sat one per row on the bus. We ate meals in our hotel rooms or else
one person per table. In conference rooms, we sat one per table and used microphones or shouted at
each other.

That’s why I’m so hoarse. But I was tested, and I knowl don’t have Covld.

Subject: Emergency Preparedness, Comnavirus, and Products from MPI

Hi Anthony Fauci,

I know you‘re busy, but I wanted to introduce our Company, Medical Partners
Imemational, and talk for a quick minute about what we do and how it can help you.
As you know, the CDC has asked all healthcare facilities to prepare for the "worst
case scenario" around the Novel Coronavirus. As much of our medical supply
manufacturing in the US comes from overseas, it is of critical import to look at
potential shortages of key products that will be needed to perform basic 1? functions
in your facility. We have already seen challenges with N95 masks, and l have heard
about potential shortages of items like disinfection wipes. We at MPI have a couple
ofunique solutions you need to consider:

PurcTabs and PurcOne NaDCC tablets that are diluted in tap water to create HOCl for
surface disinfection, They are currently used in electrostatic Sprayers to offer greater
coverage around your equipment. If, for some reason, there‘s a challenge getting the
electrostatic Sprayers in the future (and we've already seen shortages and delays in
getting new units), simply use our NaDCC tablets with spray bottles from your local
store to apply the HOCI for disinfection Our tablets have kill claims for C. diff in
four minutes. and like a number of other cleaning agents. we believe we can be
effective against the Novel Coronavirus. The problem with the other products out
there comes down to availability, particularly of the N95 masks that are required on
their IFU‘s. With our product, an N95 mask is recommended, but not required, which
is a huge distinction ifyou have run out of N95 masks.

Secondly, we have our protective scrubs, lab coats and privacy curtains from Prime
Medical. Co-branded with Clorox, these products create a 3 log (99.9%) barrier
against bacteria and viruses when washed with bleach. The barrier lasts for 12 weeks,

 

so there's a dramatically lower chance of passing something along. These are a great
protective measure for your staff. The CDC mentioned that sodium hypochloritc
(bleach) may be effective against Novel Coronavirus, so it stands to reason that our
scrubs will help against unwanted spreading as well.

Finally, we have our Path-O-Wrap, which protects mattresses and gurneys from the
harsh chemicals used during cleaning. It also can help dramatically when a
catastrophic event happens, as you simply put these on a gumey or mattress and
remove them between patients. It was invented by an EMT for just this purpose, and
may be exactly what you need for your Emergency Preparedness Program.

We also have other great 1? products such as:

o UV Disinfection Boxes to create a "touch-less check»in" to protect staff and
patients alike
. HealthySole UV solutions for the bottom of feet for OR and other sensitive
areas
. Bowman Cover Your Cough Stations
1 have attached a couple of brochures for your review. We can provide you with a
quote, or have our local representative bring in samples of some of the products to
show. Simply write me back with what you would like more information on. We feel

our products will make a difference for your facility; let us know how we can help.

Sincerely,

Medical Partners International

Dear Doctor Fauci,

lam writing to you as a member of the SPEAC project which CEPI has funded to assist with the
evaluation of the safety of vaccinesin their portfolio. As part of this effort, we are assisting
with developing preclinical and clinical testing criteria to evaluate the risk of enhanced disease
following vaccination with CDVID-19 vaccine candidates. As you know, this had been an issue
with some prior SARS vaccine candidates.

We are convening a two day virtual meeting of experts via video conference next week on
March 12 and 13 between 8am and 1 pm Eastern time each day. Participants In the meeting
are shown inthe attached agenda but include Paul Henri Lambert from Geneva and Barney
Graham from NIH. The meeting will actively involve the participants on the agenda the first day
and on the second day the meeting will be open for several peer reviewers including Stanley
Plotkin and Andy Pollard to review and comment on possible small and NHP animal models as
well as appropriate immunologic testing to be done in early phase one trials.

i am wanted to make you aware of the meeting so that you could attend all or part as an
observer if you wish but also to invite you to consider joining on day two as one of our formal
peer reviewers, The goal of the meeting would be to share recommendations with CEPI
COVID-19 developers as well as other interested parties.

Any comments you have on the agenda or draft questions for consideration would be greatly
appreciated.

i look forward to hearing back from you.

Abstract

Background: Although the SARS-CoVJ viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used
for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-IS) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-Z nucleic acid
(RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the covr0-19 patients, However, it is not clear that if the
incidence oi RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific
class of patients, Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General
Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China The patients were
dlvrded into three groups according to the Diagnose and Treatment of New Coronavrrus Pneumonia
(version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were
collected The serum viral load detection and serum lL-6 levels were determined Except for routine
statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status

NIHmrmas

 

prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct valuei Findings: The Result showed that Case: with
RNAaemia were exclusivelv confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness
severity, Further more, the inflammatory cvtokine |L>6 levels were Signiﬁcantly elevated in criticallv ill
patients which is almost 10-fcld3 higher than those in either patients More impertantiy, the extremely
high lLrG level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia [R=0.902) and the vital signs of
coma-19 patients 1R: 43.532). Interpretation

Subject: Re: 2019-nCoV Testing for Public Health labs

Tony:

lam loath to contact you given that I an sure you are overwhelmed. However, we are now being
contacted by sources at tertiary academic hospitals with CLlA-high complexity clinical labs who are
alarmed about their inability to scale u: SARS-CoVZ qRT-PCR testing in their facilities in the time frame
they feel is neccesary, even after Saturday's FDA regulatory guidance and the availability of integrated
DNA Technology's testing reagents. [An example of such an email is below.) lam passing this along wlth
the hopes that if you can do something about it, you Will. From an email:

“We have experience bringing up laboratory developed tests. We have never submitted an
EUA before. For our current LDTs. they are typically for pathogens that we have some
experience with, positive clinical samples are readily available, and/or appropriate control
materials (6 g. bacteria. viral genomes) are readily commercially available. None ofthose
are true for SARSrCoVZ. There is tremendous concern about deploying a suboptimal test
into a challenging environment.

The EUA guidance from FDA is not unreasonable for the validation of a new respiratory
virus test. and it gives an accurate picture oi'lhc amount oflesting that is required to bring
on a new test by the lab. Federal law requires us to perform accuracy, reproduci lity,
analytical sensitivity / LOD. and analytical speciﬁcity (cross reactivity) studies. Those
studies require positive control material inrludi‘ngintact virus or RNA Clinical labs are not
prepared to generate RNA Iranscript, and we don’t usually source these ourselves. We
can’t get the virus without ﬁlling out extensive paperwork that requires multiple
signatures. Gclting control mania] for validation one of the biggest issues.

 

Prior to the EUA change, the calculus for our labs was that it would take 3 to 4 weeks to
actually validate a test, and then we would submit to the FDA for EUA (a process none of
us has ever done), and then we would wait for the FDA to respond (hopefully in the
afﬁrmative). I think we all expected the FDA EUA review to be at least 4 weeks. Based on
that time-line. many commercial vendors would have reagents available with their own
hUAs that would be able to be performed on large automated instruments including
potentially STAT. None of the LDT assays (or CDC assay) can be performed STAT or on
demand.

With the EUA change, the process to validate the t t is still the sum: and will still take 3
or more weeks. Once validated. we can petfonn cl cal testing (like any other LDT) while
we submit the EUA. This would likely allow us to begin testing several weeks before
commercial vendors have EUA reagents available based upon our best current
information. Most of us expect to transition a commercial EUA at some point.

The recent statement that lDT reagents can be used under the EUA from CDC is
misleading. It applies to a very limited number of lots (currently 1, likely 2 soon), it
assumes reagents are available, and it requires strict adherence to the CDC protocol using
identical extraction methods (2 choices) and ampliﬁcation / detection methods (1
instrument). It still speciﬁes the use of an N1. N2. and N3 reactions, but CDC has dropped
the N3 reaction. The EUA has not yet been updated. Netther of our hospitals have the
complete extraction or ampliﬁcation instrttments so we have to do the EUA anyway.“

Hope you are coping uk,
James

Subject: Covid-IS causes CR5 (and source of mortality)
Hi Steve,
This is an interesting paper from intensivists in Wuhan. The IF oi the journal is 18 too.

Looks like covid»15 causes an |L»6 mediated CR5 with myocarditis, which is associated with mortality
(more so than the pneumonltls).

This suggests we should be more concemed with getting tacillzumab for critically ill covid-le patients,
rather than tamiflu and ARVT.,.

Do you have a friend at the CDC that could use this info?

I know the demands on you have skyrocketed, so I am circling back te confirm you are still
available on Friday March 20 for the COVlD719 event, and also to seek your advice. as we
amend the layout oi the event, including possibly having it run a little longer.

I am still hoping you can do a big picture scene setter (15-20 minutes with slides)

(i) The state of the science surrounding the virus, what we know and do not
know,

(ii) Progression of the outbreak

(iii) Testing

(iv) Status of accelerated early work on vaccines, antivirals

We will have a panel that covers China, and we may add a panel on the epicenters in Italy,
ROK, Iran

I would like to carve out ample space for discussion of the United States. in your view, is it
advisable to put a request forward to Secy Azar or VP Pence? Neither needs a platform to
have their voices heard But perhaps they would see this sort of setting as an opportunity,
ll not the Secy a! VP, is there anyone else you might propose? I had reached out earlier to
Steve Biegun to speak on the foreign policy dimensions, especially regarding China. but
have not heard back,

I have separately reached out to the NGA about possibly enlisting a governor to speak

 

If you are free and wish to speak by phone abou! any of this, please let me know.

Hi Tony,

lust a short notice to tell you that you are becoming even more popular in italy as your face and
interviews are everywhere on the main Italian broadcasting news and journals.

it seems like to be in USA again for me, as | see you every day and i can tell you are doing well although
you must be overwhelmed with all this. I was supposed to be at NIH in tre weeks from now. but I have

cancelled the night and travel due to h ghest restrictions from CDC and HHs ror ltalian travellers rrorn
Lombardia and Veneto (and i live in Milan).
can we estimate how long all this wlll last? Weeks or months according to you knowledge?

Hope to see you soon anyway and I really hope U.S. outbreak will not turn as bad as the Italian one.
lndeed, Mllan Is living a real unprecedented (for modern time) and Surreallstlc situatlon with a rnlx of
lear, panic and incredulity among people. It almost seems a movie! The government shut down half
country by closing all schools and universities, by not allowing meetings of any kind, by limiting travels in
many places and by placing severe restrictions in social life. They even stopped the Fashion week in
Milan that is a big thing here.

Maybe too late, but they didi it and we hope it will work somehow to reach a plateau in contagious.

have a nice day

Good morning Dre Fausi,

lam not one to write emails to our leaders in government as i am sure that the message doesn‘t get to
where it always needs to go, At the risk of you possibly seeing this email, you need to know that you are
doing an incredible job.

I doubt you will be broadcastingthis note but you should know that my husband and I take great
comfort in seeing you up on the podium next to our country's leadership on the COVlD-IS pandemic.
Vou are a steady voice of reason and the right person forthe job. Even when the President doesn't get it
quite right, you manage to be professional in your delivery, information and steadfast manner. We can
easily look past the President but we listen when you speak.

From the first time I heard you say on a Sunday morning talk show, ”if you think we are overacting then

we are probably doing the right things." I live in Maine and we are a rural state so we probably won't
see the numbers that are elsewhere but we are listening and acting on your words of caution.

NIH Production to ICAN_001401 "mam”

I can't imagine how much pressure you are under doing yourjob but we need more leadership such as
yours, How you choose your words so carefully without getting flustered is a gifts I can only hope that
you will continue to be the voice to get this country through this unprecedented events

Stay healthy and keep doing what you're doing as it matters so much to this nation,

Sincerely,

Ka ren L. Backma n

Coronavirus hero: Anthony Fauci is a great

public servant in a time of great public need
Fauci is the world's leading authority on infectious diseases
and the best person in the country to help us deal with the
COVID-19 crisis.

David M. Rubenstein

Opinion contributor

Some viewers of the daily White House coronavirus briefings may wonderwhy everyone increasingly
defers to a diminutive, Brnoklyn-acrenred 79-yearvnirl dortnr, Trmy Fauci,

They do because, as I have learned over many years of talking with and more recently interviewing this
man, he is without doubt the world‘s leading authority on infectious diseases. In any area of human
activity or knowledge, there always seems to be one person who is the global gold standard. In the
world of infectious diseases that person is Tony Fauci.

So the American people — indeed, people around the globe — should be grateful that Tony has dug into
this crisis with the same work-aroundethe-clock, just-the—facts ma’am style that he has used

while serving underand working with six LLB. presidents. He is as apolitical as anvone can be. I have no
idea if he is registered with any political party; i suspect thoughthat he is rabidly Independent. His only
focus is getting the facts out, providing the best health care treatment and information possible, and
saving lives

A top expert from AIDS to Ebola

Tony Fauci 'oined the National institutes of Health in 1968, after completing his medical training at Weill
Cornell Medical Center, and he has led the National institute of Allergyand Infectious Disease since 1984
7 36 years. Hard to believe anyone can run anything that long and still be atthe top ofhis game. But
Tony is. During this period, he has dealt With every serious infectious disease challenge _ malaria,
Among Tony's best known accomplishments, beyond simply runningthe institute and training dozens of
the world's top infectious disease professionals, has been helpingto discover how HIV leads to AIDS
and, later, leading the effortto create lat President George W. Bush's directioni the President's
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has transformed the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Africa,
and other parts of the developingworld. Millions of lives have been saved by this program alone. More
recently, he has been an architect and powerful advocate ofPresident Donald Trump’s plan forending
the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. through HIV antiretroviral therapy targeted to disease hotspots.

NIH Production to ICAN_001407

In his spare time, Tony has been involved with writing or editing more than 1,100 scholarly articles and
several textbooks, and, in the process, has become one of the most cited authorities of the entire
medical profession.

For these breakthrough activities and his dedicated service (at a government salary) for more than a half
century (he worked at NIH for 16 years before assuming his current role), Tony has received, and
earned, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Lasker Award (called the American Nobel by many).
With this long service and universal acclaim, one might think Tony would let it get to his head, at least a
little bit. Not the case, though.

Selfless commitment to public service

He is readily accessible to those who need treatment — he still runs a lab at NIH — orneed
information. Tony still lives in the same house he bought when he ﬁrst moved to Washington, and it is
there that he and his wife Christine have raised theirthree talented daughters (though none ofthem
chose to attend medical school)

Untilthe latest crisis, Tony has often commuted to NIH by Metro, typically after running three miles for
his daily exercise. And when he has been invited to make speeches in the Washington area or on Capitol
Hill, he invariably turns down a car and driverfor the Metro. (This practice has had to change of late for
the obvious reasons).

There are, of course, many other dedicated federal servants who also view their commitment to the
country and its people over financial rewards. But surely no federal civil servant, in any area, can exceed
Tony Fauci's long—term and selfless commitment to this country and the health of its people.

  
  

I tried years ago, when Tony was approaching a normal retirement age, to see if he might want after a
normal lifetime of federal service, to take some of his considerable Skills and knowledge to the private
sector. He quickly said no — money did not motivate him, serving the country did. And he stayed at NIH
— to the country’s good fortune.

If there is any one medical professional who can help the country deal with the COVlD-19 crisis, it is
Tony Fauci, an example of the best this country has to offer.

He is not a miracle worker. No one is.

But Tony Fauci has the decades of experience needed to understand infectious disease problems and
prescribe a treatment that should, in time, provide the requisrte comfort, even if, in the short term, the
medicine is painful and inconvenient.

Hi Hilary,

afternoon (2 - 5 PM). Tony is enthusiastic about our doing this, but his presence is unfortunately
doubtful, given all of the other demands he faces, l’m counting on you and Cliff to be there, however —
is this etched on your calendars?

Tony --
First nfall. thank you for all you are doing to lead our country's response during this crisis

I hesitate to reach out to you with so much on your plate, but I think this idea might help with the
national response.

In light ofthe continuing challenge ofengagmg young people in social distancmg measures,
combined with the fact that so many colleges and universities are now teaching online,
Georgetown‘s Global Health Initiative and Institute for Politics and Public Service are
considering a "vinual town hall" in which you could speak directly with students at colleges and
universities via Zoom (or some other platform) about the collective challenge of COVID-19 and
its risk to their health and to other members of their communities.

This could be a unique forum for you, as the most trusted person in the public dialogue. to make
the case directly to young people about their Vital role in social distancing to ﬂatten the curve in
their communities. We would use social media, ofeourse. to push out key segments and
messages from this event more broadly.

While Georgetown would organize this "virtual town hall”. we would work closely with a
network of more than 30 colleges and universities with which our Institute of Politics and Public
Service regularly collaborates. We would also reach out to other schools to ensure a geographic
reach and a mix of public and private institutions. Ofcourse, our team would work closely with
your staffto manage all logistics so as to use your scarce time as efﬁciently as possible.

Before we go any further in planning or thinking about this‘ I wanted to see ifyou would have
time to participate or think this is a good idea.

Best!
John

Good morning, from Vancouver, Canada,
We hope you are keeping yourself, and your families safe.

Your calm approach, and real life experience being shared during the daily briefings
is what everyone looking towards the USA for information needs to see.

As in anything, real knowledge, both sharing and accepting is critical to get
everyone focused on overcoming the current situation,

We don't see social distancing between everyone at the news conferences, and
that is disappointing, we also don't see Donald Trump acquiring the skills and
abilities to truly turn over communication and leadership to people such as
yourself and your colleagues on the podium.

While that is also disappointing, it has come to be expected, therefore easy to tune
out.

Our Global world needs a Global approach of honesty and transparency, we can't
afford to get this one wrong due to our normal tribal tendencies.

Best regards, be safe,

Dear Prof. Anthony Fauci,
Good Morning!

1 am Dr. Jamuna R. Subramaniam. I did my PhD from Georgetown University and
postdoc in Johns Hopkins on neurodegenerative diseases. After returning to India I
started working on biogenic amine neuortransmitters. One of the major trajectory of
my research career was on an FDA approved, antihypenensive drug,

Given the current scenario of ACE2 being the receptor for Covidel‘). and the widely
used antihypertensive drugs also target the same. I thought of sensitizing you on a
very effective antihyperlensive drug, adelphane and adelphane esidrex made and
sold by Novarrtis This contains a historical VMAT — biogenic amines loading in
synaptic vesicles, molecule. reserpine. Here. in lndia. a well known Nephrologist,
has used this to treat a community ofelose to 3000 patients for almost two

decades. From him and others I have heard that it is a very effective, well tolerated
antihypertensive. Reserpine is a historical molecule that it had been used in the
Indian system ofmedieine, Ayurveda. But adelphane has the single speciﬁc puriﬁed
molecule, reserpine, an alkaloid. Now Novar'itis has stopped making it. One of the
reasons being given is reserpine 5 negative publicity when it was used an
antipsychotic drug. The reason given was a srde etfect of severe depression. We did
a study on these patients on adelphane and ﬁnd that it had not caused depression.
Further. it seems to be retaining cognition in these patients. I could not publish these
in big joumals as you can understand I am enclosing these two papers.

NIH Production to ICAN_001441 "mantras?

As many lives are at stake, [thought I will sensitize you on this. Hope something
good will come out of this. I am telling whomever I come across about the same.
That is the best I can do. Hope the current scenario will show the living daylight for
reserpine and helps the humanity,

Thank you

Dear Dr. Fauei.

I used to work in Bob Goldberg‘s division at the NCI (Blgd 37) from '78-‘80. I'm now a
rheuinzitulugisl in the SF Bay Area.

I'm including a Letter tn the Editor (submitted 319.20) for the NEJM that proposes a cost-
cffct-tive therapy for COVID19. (I've included a slightly longer version with more
references):

N-acetyl (Vsteine tar Caronavlrus

Abbreviations: N»acetyl cysteine (NACl, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)

In a recent letter to Cell Research, Remdesivir and chloroquine were found
to inhibit the SARS GOV-2 (COVID-19) virus activity and replication in Vero
cells (1). That study was the basis for current clinical trials involving those
medicines.

There might be a more cost-effective treatment for the Coronavirus. I believe
it will be sensitive to oral high dose N-acetyl Cysteine

A ﬁnal common pathway to host destruction (autophagy) in infected cells in

both Corona and Rota viral infections involves the PISK/AKT/mTOR pathway
(23). This pathway is inhibited by “rapalogues” (like Rapamycin) where the

NIH Production to ICAN_001444 "'Hmmm

viral infection is stopped and the host cell survives. N-acetyl-cysteine, a
potent anti-oxidant and glutathione precursor. alters the redox state of
treated cells and can quench this same pathway (4,5). NAC (N-acetyl
cysteine) has been used to rapidly clear Rotavirus diarrheal infections in
children (6). Furthermore, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus

(PEDV) coronavirus has been studied in Vero cells. In vitro, NAC blocks
that particular virus (7), and in viva, NAC blocks intestinal damage caused
by this virus (5). NAC likely provides a "redox clamp" on the autophagy
pathway this virus exploits.

Since the PEDV coronavirus is effectively blocked in Vero cells by NAC. the
SARS—CoV—Z (COVlD-19) will likely also be inhibited. This test should be
done, and if positive, clinical trials ought to follow.

Doses of 2.4-3.5 g/d of NAG have been used to treat patients with Lupus
(4i. That dose is well tolerated and inexpensrve.

If NAC were effective in symptomatic patients, it could add a cost-effective
measure of protection to healthcare workers and exposed individuals.

Good Evening Dr Fauci

My name is Ryan Pittman llive In M62 South Carolina, right outside of "$19.51
The virus is here. Seeing as this Is likely to get worse before it gets better I want to
be prepared to help people' In my neighborhood when they start developing
symptoms and the hospitals are not readyfor them.

How do you recommend I go about doing this. i am prepared to acquire a modest
stockpile of supplies to give to those suffering through this, but I am not entirely
sure what would be best. The hope is to take your information and pass it on to
those in other neighborhoods in the area, so we can come together and help as
many people as we can get through this pandemic.

Thank you for your time.

Dear Prof. Fauci,

May [ brieﬂy introduce myself: My name is Andreas Kronbichler, 1 am nephrologist
based in Austria, and do have an interest in renal autoimmune disease. As such, 1
know your landmark study about cyclophosphamide use in GPA published in 1971;
and I have learned that you were involved in the management of David Fajgenbaum
MCD, whose story 15 so impressive.

I am contacting you and asking you for your help regarding a multidisciplinary FAQ
article we would like to write and which does make sense in our eyes. given the
rapid spread ofthis devastating infectious disease.

We would like to invite experts in the ﬁeld to comment on a selected topic and then
summarize this as a paper with hopefully high impact in the ﬁeld.

lfyou agree, can you answer this question (around 400 words max):

Can you describe rhepathopliysiulugy and some ufthe immunolagﬂ‘al aspects of
SAKS-Ca V-Z infectiun and COVID-I9 disease?

I would be personally very honored to work together with you. A selection of topics
is attached to this e-mail.

With best regards.

Hi Tony,

Nice Facebook session with Zuckl And I heard you werejust on CNN, but I missed that one. I did an
interview with Sheila Kaplan late this afternoon — and she greatly appreciated your message of apology.

wonmink—.

When we spoke yesterday, you were enthusiastic about the convening of a 2 — 3 hoursession of IC
Directors and SMEs from their le, to brainstorm about additional scientiﬁc efforts that could be
mounted at NIH to address COVIDJS, It looks as ifthis can be arranged for an early afternoon next
week, Obviously there would be nothing better than to have you there in person for this. While I know
your schedule is not exactly under your control, is there any 2 — 3 hour period next week that might
have a chance of being open foryou? If not, who would you want to be the presenter of the current

pm". or m investments? _

We have the NIH virtual Town Meeting at 1 PM tomorrow. Is there any chance you can come to Wilson
Hall in person for that? If not, is there a chance you can call in? I will serve as moderator, and after a
few minutes of opening remarks. would hope to turn this over to you for ten minutes or so of the
unique Fauci perspective. After that, Larry and Alfred will talk for a few minutes about the NIH COVlD
Response Team, and Jim Gilman will talk about what’s happening at the CC. Then we’ll open it up to
questions, which we can accept in real time from the estimated 20,000 staff who will be logged in. But
you wouldn’t need to stay for all that— if we could somehow have your participation (either in person or
on the phone) from about 1:101o 1:20, that would be really wonderful. Please let me know if that will
be possible.

Sorry about the long e—mail, Get some sleep!

Abstract
Ba ckgrou nd
No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-
2.
Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with
confirmed SARS—CoV-Z infection, whicl’ causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation

lSaozl «94% orless while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio ofthe partial pressure of oxygen
(P302) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fioz) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned
in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Iopinavir—ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14
days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical
improvement, defined asthe time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a
seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.

Results

A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-Z infection underwent randomization; 99
were assigned to the lopinavir—ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with
lopinavir—ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical
improvementlhazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.90 to 1.7Zl.

NIH Production to ICAN_001465 "trimmer

Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavirrritonavir group and the standard-care group (192% vs.
250%; difference, -5,8 percentage points: 95% CI, —17.3 to 5,7), The percentages of patients with
detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to»treat analysis,
lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that
observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 139; 95% Cl. 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events
were more common in the |opinavir~ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in
the standardrcare group. Lopinavir‘ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (133%)
because of adverse events.

it help the cause for me to accept some of those, or is it better to hold off? if I were to engage,

Hi Dr. Fauci,

I'm now back in my office. I typed the original message on
phone. Ijust noticed a bunch of typos. Below is a better
version.

Regards,

Erik

Dear Dr. Fauci,

You‘re beyond busy but I hope you read this message.

(a) (4)

I'm only mentioning
this so you don't think I'm a paranoid freak. I‘m convinced you
already know the outbreak is way past the point of containment,
and, unfortunately, herd immunity will soon ensue. Then,
outbreak 2 will happen shortly after, and, hopefully, not ad
infinitum.

I'm writing to make sure you already know or at least suspect
everything I'm about to tell you. I need to clear my conscience

NIH Production to ICAN_001473 "mums

because it‘s possible (albeit unlikely) that some of what tell you is
new and possibly useful in, at least, saving lives in the USA.

I'm a physicist and have been modeling this outbreak since
January. My panic started minutes after I learned ~5M people
left Wuhan around January 22 a few days before the CCP starting
locking the country down. The 5M people scattered to 13,000+
cities in China to visit family & friends for the Lunar Festival
(Chinese New Year). I've been communicating with quite a few
people around the world including an NYU epidemiologist “"53

. We've both been warning
our families, to mostly deaf ears at first, since January. It's been
frustrating and exhausting, but, ﬁnally, most are as prepared as
possible for what's about to happen.

I have lots of information about China due to my business,
scientific, friendship, and other ties with many there, including
lmmunologists & virologists at top-tier institutions and
laboratories. My WeChat account (like Skype / Whatapp) was
blocked by the CCP for 3 days late February / early March, but,
after a warning message, it is now unblocked. I'm willing to
share with you everything I know, think I know, or seriously
suspect.

Here are a few examples:

I'm confident that China stop counting dead COVID-19 infected
bodies since ~January 7, 2020. They‘ve been adding fabricated
data daily to show (to save face) the world and their own people
an impressive flattening of China outbreak curve. It's easy to
prove this via data analysis because, for example, improbable
coincidences occurred in much of the data. My suspicions were
eventually confirmed by at least two of my sources in China
( clans)

). The data posted by
China is not only garbage, it has misled the world into a false
sense of security wrt death rate, age vs death, and other things;
that is, if people analyzed the world's data including China, the

NIH Production to ICAN_001474 "'Hmm

results are heavily biased towards nonsense, because China‘s
number of cases accounted for the majority of cases worldwide
(until a day or so ago).

I want to emphasize that] do not believe China intentionally did
this to harm the world. I sincerely believe it was done for saving-
face reasons. Saving face is possibly the most powerful
motivating force in China. it is the key to understanding how
most Chinese think and why they do what they do. China wanted
the world to believe that their Herculean quarantining efforts
contained the outbreak. However, I don't think this is true, even
after spraying ~billions of gallon of "Clorox" all the country. The
number of body bags my contacts told me about about, even
after short 15-minutes walk to/from grocery stores in one city
during CCP-authorized time slots, suggest the number of deaths
is several orders of magnitude larger than what China's posted
data indicates. Also, everyone I know in China continues to be in
lock down (~6+ weeks now), and several went "Silent" since
about a week ago. This greatly troubles me because those who
went silent live in Wuhan. And, yesterday, the CCP revoked
permits/license for several Foreign reporters who were trying to
learn about about the situation in Wuhan and other parts of
China. Several of my sources have told me, in coded language,
that the situation in at least Wuhan is not under control at all. In
my opinion, China is continues to be extremely concerned about
saving face (first) and their economy (second). Their economy is
already suffering terribly, and they can‘t afford to lose the many
large manufacturing and other business agreements with foreign
countries. This is why I believe they're trying, and succeeding to
convince many, to convince most of their population that the
outbreak is under control, and it will soon be ok to return to work
-- even though it will not be safe, because of current outbreak
and outbreak # 2 that will likely start soon. Citizens are not
allowed to travel beyond a few stores and, in special cases, their
work office, so even people who live their have no idea what's
really going on especially in Hubei province including Wuhan.
Also, an H15N outbreak seems to have recently started in

NIH Production to ICAN_001475

humans in Hunan province (which neighbors Hubei/Wuhan area).

I also have lots of information about USA.
Here is some:

I believe that many COVID-19 deaths were incorrectly labelled at
2019-2020 flu deaths. The spreading in the USA is almost
certainly already homogeneous, because it's been going on since
last year without any containment whatsoever. Once massive
testing finally starts, this truth/reality will, unfortunately, become
obvious. It will manifest itself as hyper exponential (hyperbolic)
growth starting a day or two after the millions of testing kits
arrive and start being used. The hyper exponential dynamics will
eventually evolve to a more accurately calibrated exponential
curve once the number to tests is large enough to properly
sample the population. I don't think Italy is ahead of us. I think
we‘re ahead and by a large amount.

A few other quick bits of info...

The time between infection and death seems to have decreased
from about ~20 days (a few months) ago to possibly as short as
~8 days. And, the incubation period seems to be significantly
longer. Both, and other data I‘ve looked at, strongly suggest at
least one mutation has occurred. This is extremely concerning to
me. Another concern is the distribution of deaths vs. age appears
to not be as strongly biased, compared to when China data was
included, towards older people and/or people with chronic health
conditions.

Over the past 15+ years, I've traveled to China multiple times
per year. I'm pretty sure you've known this for a while, but I
truly believe the outbreak tsunmai in the USA is either already
happened or is about to happen. As you know, as soon as a
surge is sensed, the Tsunami will immediately follow. I believe
we missed the containment boat quite a while ago. I've been

NIH Production to ICAN_001476

closely listening to your comments on TV, and I'm pretty sure
you've already come to the same conclusion but don't want to
cause mass panic (I understand that).

I'm 99% sure that SARS-CoV-Z been spreading in the USA since
late November earl December last ear.

knows how many people in Alaska got it too, but I suspect many

tens of thousands possible much more.
but it has been impossible to get

tested. I've called 5 places in Alaska and none wanted me to
come it for the test.

I've instructed my family and, recently (after family), close
friends to get some Alvesco (ciclesonide) for emergency use
only. I've been told by colleagues on the front-line in Japan,
China, and Korea, and found several pre—print papers, that it is
an effective treatment for late-stage COVID-19 patients. Some
patients on ventilators who were approaching death have fully
recovered after treatment with ciclesonide; ciclesonide has much
smaller particles than other corticosteroids so it reaches deeper
into lungs and alveolis) . Also, the treatment seems to be a
potent suppressor of virus replication. Recovered patients have
tested negative shortly after the treatment. Of course, data is
limited so can‘t be sure the treatment is effective. However,
because Alvesco has been shown to be safe for infant - 100+
year—old patients, I'm ok with my family and I having it for
emergency use. That is, only if healthcare facilities are unable to
accept them or me as a patient to treat with ventilator,

NIH Production to ICAN_001477 ”Mm

corticosteroids (or whatever the best available treatment is at
that time). Having Alvesco in our emergency kits is a much
better option that someone avoidably dying because of an
overburdened healthcare facility. The other drug I have, and
have told my family and some friends to get, is called
hyroxychloriquine -- also seem to be effective and safe. But, I
think Alvesco is better because it appears to prevent the virus
from replicated so infection is wiped out and no longer
contagious. Alvesco seems to be two silver bullets in one.

I don‘t believe in coincidences and I‘m not a conspiracy theorist,
but there are many things out of Iran that also concern me
greatly. That‘s all I say right now.

If all of this is old news to you, then I would greatly appreciate a
response. It can be as short as "yes". Anyway, I had to share this
information with you. Now my conscience is clear. My concern is
that it's possible you don't have some of the above info, so I
decided to send you this message.

I wrote this quickly, so I apologize in advance for any typos,
etc.

I truly appreciated your efforts, and I'm now confident that
President Trump, you, and everyone else involved is doing
everything possible to ensure the best possible outcomes. 1 was
deeply concerned a few weeks ago, when the gravity of the
situation seemed to not be fully recognized by several in DC.

Feel free to call me anytime. My cell # is below. If you do call, I
will keep anything we discuss confidential (if necessary).

Tony—

I know you're ridiculously busy so please do not be upset with me, but I am frustrated and yes angry.
Again, I think you have to hear from the front line while formulating policy.

Today at the RW clinicl dealt with at least 12 URl's with fever.

We cannot test,

We have no PPE in clinic.

We have a case that tested positive for influenza then SARS»COV~2-rthis scared me the most

given I'm trying to r/o COVID-19 by doing PCR for other respiratory viruses,

- 0n the drive home just now, the gyms, barrgrilles and restaurants still packed. Ves, bars are
closed in Floridarrbut if they serve food (which they all do) ....... they're open. Ans, so much for
the 50% capacity "suggestion”.

- The beaches still full for Spring Break. Look atthe pics of St Pete.

I The DOH? This is from the the FL DOH just a few hours ago. Ves, this is TODAV.

a...

“If a cluster of conﬁrmed cases were to be discovered in Florida, the department would
move quickly to engage with and isolate any infected individuals to prevent further
spread," said Alberto Moscoso, the state health department‘s spokesman.

I don‘t have to explain to you how ridiculous that statement is.

- I‘ve written to our DOH and Governor DeSantis three times (including speaking with hrs staff)
asking to close restaurants (aside from take out), gyms, beaches etc. They are "monitoring".

Subject: Please read- Idea for Mask Shortage

I have an idea to HELP with the MASK SHORTAGE!

Please don’t disregardthis, as this could help our whole country!

I know we are concerned as a nation about a mask shortage and I have an idea to what might help,
IDon’t know who to go to that can help implement thisand want your input if you thinkthis is a viable
aid, then maybe you can help me reach the right people to make the biggest impact, maybe even up to
the Coronavirus team in the White House.

I have— 8t when I first heard about China quarantining 43 million people Igot
worried about masks, I looked up how to sew a maskfor myself& familyt lfound a site that talked about
sewing masks for cancer treatment patients and to use 100% quilters cotton for outside Sr 100% flannel
cotton on inside. I started sewing several. 1 know they aren't the N95, but they are better than nothing
IF neededt My Dr just told me yesterday not to go anywhere without a mask because it’s too much of a
risk for my health. It got me thinking. What if while people across the country were in home quarantine,
ALL those who know how to sew, they sew these masks to donate in their communities. Not for use
against Coronavirus, but for other things normal masks are used (food prep, non-sickness medical
reasons, etc) then they aren't using upthe valuable higher rated masks that are needed fordoctors,
nurses 81 first responders fighting Coronavirus. These masks can also be washed as needed again and
again which will just keep saving other masks.

During the WH Press Release this morring, Seema expresses the need for masks & Dr Birx explained
how the virus is being spread from surfaces, but that it can't survive in fabric. Which means maybe these
cloth masks will even help against the spread of the virus.

Either way, if you can help ok for these to be used in some manner vs a medical mask being used will
help prolong the need for more masksand hopefully 3M can have more made by then so we never have
to experience an lack of masks.

What do you think?

Dear Dr Fauci,

First of all, thank you for all the hard work you've done to help mitigate the
coronavirus outbreak. We're clearly not there yet, but are further along with your
efforts.

I'm not sure whom to contact about this, and so am writing you because I'm
confidant you can get it to the right hands. With regards to the recent closures to
Europe and so many Americans coming home, I was at first heartened to hear that
all Americans returning would be medically screened and encouraged to/made to
quarantine for 14 days. However, I was then disheartened to learn that that hasn't
been the case, at least through this past Saturday.

mm was on business in Amsterdam last week and rushed home last Thursday
after hearing on Wednesday evening about President Trump's Friday midnight
shutdown. He came in through LAX from Amsterdam. and wasn't asked any
medical questions, nor was he asked to quarantine. Then a friend came in through
Miami from Paris on Saturday, and was only given a short medical form to fill out,
and then let go. No medical cneck, no temperature screening, no further questions.
From touchdown to taxi (plus picking up bags), 45 minutes total.

Having lived in Singapore through SARS, I'm deeply disturbed. We had
medical/temperature checks at all airports, and mandatory quarantines for anyone
with possible contact with a SARS contact/patient. The virus was quickly and
efficiently contained, and the same has been done in Singapore to date with Covid
19.

I was heartened last Friday as I learned that the federal government was onboard,
and hearing about significant measures that would be taken soon. I must say I've
been disheartened as of today, with not enough tests, mask, respirators and
ventilators in place. And then hearing of the lack of medical screenings at airports.
Please help, as I know you've so desperately been trying to do. And please help to
stem any incorrect information going out from our President, information which

NIH Production to ICAN_001489 NIHmw'

gives us hope for a couple of days, and then clashes that and puts many into a
frenzied despair. We can cope with what's happening, and will continue to change
our behavior per the guidelines, but only with information that's accurate

Thank you, and keep safe,

Dear Dr. Anthony Fauci.

My name Is Ivan Booardo and am a 1km U .8. Army Medic (68W) deployed to
Afghanistan in 2011- 2012. I can send you my resume so you can see my skills and abilities that I
can bring to the table. _Arn currently In nursing school ( R. N. )in Rego Park Queens with a

My school ( _ Mitzi) has
recieved a request from New York Governor Cuomo 5 ofﬁce looking for nursing students to help
volunteer. However many students like myself are very hesitant to volunteer for the simple fact
that it will interfere with our studies and we will still have to comply with class assignments and
class exams and especially with ﬁnal exams this current semester coming up at the middle to
end of April 2020. Yet many of my fellow classmates would love a chance to stand up and
deliver help during these trying tirnes However our school will not except any excuses for
lateness or absence even though we are now on an online learning as of this moment, So our
greatest fear is that we wont ﬁnish this semester and will not be able to start next semester ( It
starts April 28. 2020 for our schoo l... basically 2 semesters wasted and it will push back our
graduation date and furthermore incur more student loans in order to continue with school

This is why i am writing to your ofﬁce if an exception can he made and we can have OTJ (on the
job training for nursing) and recieve credit and for our current semester and possibly our next
semester. Many of the students I speak about already have a Bachelor's degree ( I myself have
a B. S In Biology from _ , W 7 HQ!) and many are or have worked as Nurse
aides in many NYC area local hospitals with many years of excellent experience. Imagine if you
are able to approve this for many nursing school students' In lost the New York City area and
Long Island SuburbsThis would be virtually an untapped experienced workforce of

literally hundreds perhaps maybe thousands of hands on personnel ready to go to help relieve
the over burdened health system workers and provide additional reinforcements due to the
coronavirus. ln not only my area of New York city but possibly all over the country where we can
help providing help and additional assistance and reinforcements

 

Dr: Fauci, i am humbly asking for special permission, we all will need all the help we can get,
Please consider this option as this can be a win! win situation for not only NYC residents but for
other areas of the country hit hard by this crisis. I have spoken to many of my fellow
classmates and they all understand the risk and would be willing to share the burden With the

that we could potentially be away from our lamilies for an extensive unknown period of
time which we are ready lor and p'epared lor or possibly put our health on the line (00‘

I implore you lo give us a chance and only ask for special permission for OTJ in order to fully

I hope all is well with you. I am a Dermatologist practicing in the Metropolitan
Detroit area. I have done some literature searching on potential treatments
for the novel coronavirus and stumbled across a few case case reports from
China in 2005 at the time of the SARS outbreak. They detailed some
successes in treatment of severe cases with chloroquine. I saw a more
recent study showing hydroxychloroquine had better in vitro efﬁcacy than
chloroquine. Have you heard of this? Flaquenil is so innocuous, I wonder if
we shouldn'tjust try it.

I think you are doing phenomenal work and really presenting a level,

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I am writing to you because I have a question regarding Covidr19t How come you do not tell the
compete truth to the American people regarding this virus? All I hear is the bad facts about it. Why not
give people some help and tell Us the good facts about it? Good facts such as the number of actual
patients is very small compared to the whole population, most people who get it make a full and
complete recovery. Are you enjoying the senseless panic you made? Panic where people are

hoarding food/goods stealing full shopping carts from the elderly. losing their jobs/wages. inadequate
education now that schools are closed.

The number of people who will actually be sickened by the virus will be dramatically dwarfed by the
people who lose theirjobs, recelve a poor education despite their teachers best efforts and miss out on
once in a lifetime events such as weddings, graduations, communions.

What you are doing is not right for the American peoplel! Vou need to stop playing GOD and tell the
people the complete truthl! The country and the people need to get back to our normal lives NOW!!
Sincerely.

Ann Beloten

Dr Fauci,
Thank you for your guidance and expertise at this difficult time.

My friend and l are quilters. She lives may and l live law. She has created a pattern for
a fabric face mask. We read Dr. Tufekci’ s op ed' In the NYT yesterday and have been brainstorming
together ever since on ways we can help.
httpszllwww.nvtimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirusrfacermaskshtml

Several years ago I mobilized quilters throughout the US and we raised more than $1.1 milllonfor
Allheimer's Disease research. All grass roots, all volunteer. There are 7-10 million quilters in the US.

My friend and I would like to make a fabric face mask pattern available at no charge so that quilters,
sewers, and crafters can make face masks. We understand these are nowhere near medical grade, but
they would be betterthan nothing atall (See research cited in link above.) They would be made from
fabric scraps and supplies on hand; no trips to the fabric store would be necessary.

At this time there are no masks available to the public at all. Sewing for a cause would give purpose to

those of us staying home. Wearing a mask on rare occasions when we do venture outside hasthe
benefits signaling others to step back even if the masks do not protect against transmission of the virus.

NIH Production to ICAN_001508 "WWW“

We are just two individuals wanting to help. We been advised by an attorney that sharing this free
pattern might open us up to scrutiny from regulatory agencies or possible law suits. We don’t want to
step on any toes. nor do we want any legal entanglements,

Could the NIH make this pattern availaole? Or theCDC? There are millions of sewers who would be
delighted to step up and help right now. It would be great for morale, and even though it’s one step up
from nothing, iT lS SOMETHING. This could even be scaled beyond individuals making fabric face masks
for themselves. Masks could be sewn for others.

Could we please work with you?

Thank you {or your consideration,

99% of Those Who Died From Virus

ByTommaso Ebhardt, Chiara Remondini, and Marco Eertacche
March 18, 2020, 8:56 AM EDT

More than 99% of Italfs coronavirus fatalities were people who suffered from
previous medical conditions, according to a study by the country’s national
health authority.

After deaths from the virus reached more than 2,500, with a 150% increase in
the past week, health authorities have been combing through data to provide
clues to help combat the spread of the disease.

NIH Production to ICAN_001513 ”Mum“

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s government is evaluating whether to extend
a nationwide lockdown beyond the beginning of April, daily La Stampa
reported Wednesday. Italy has more than 31,500 conﬁrmed cases of the
illness.

The new study could provide insight into why Italy‘s death rate, at about 8% of
total infected people, is higher than in other countries.

The Rome—based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the
country‘s coronavirus fatalities, ﬁnding that just three victims, or 0.8% of the
total, had no previous pathology. Almost half of the Victims suffered from at
least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous
conditions.

More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third
suffered from heart disease.

The average age of those who’ve died from the virus in Italy is 79.5. As of
March 17, 17 people under 50 had died from the disease. All of Italy’s victims
under 40 have been males with serious existing medical conditions.

While data released Tuesday point to a slowdown in the increase of cases, with
a 12.6% rise, a separate study shows Italy could be underestimating the real
number of cases by testing only patients presenting symptoms,

NIH Production to ICAN_001514 "momma

According to the GIMBE Foundation, about 100,000 Italians have contracted
the Virus, daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported. That would bring back the country’s
death rate Closer to the global average of about 2%.

Hi Tony:

Thank you for what you are doing for our country to try and limit the consequences of COV|D>19. Many
Americans are hanging on your every word, as they should be, and that includes me.

A questlon about COVlD-19 mechanism of spread: The reported reproductive number from China of
about 2.6 indicates a likelihood of large droplet spread as the mode of transmission from person to
person. My question is - could there be a component of airborne spread (droplet nuclei) with this virus?
If super Spreaders exist with COVlD-19, is airborne spread possible? Knowing the answer to this question
would help to inform decisions about PPE and Decontamination in settings such as Emergency
Departments, if this is not already known definitively, could NlOSH and some key partners possibly study
it in current quarantine settings?

Thanks, Tony, God bless you and your Important work!

Without success, for more than a week. l have tried to reach any techie CDC person about the problem of

Though your workload is unimaginable, I thought you might personally know and could provide contact
information of an appropriate CDC or NIH epidemiologist

“*Brief Summary of Concept‘*‘skip to End. if obvious
Had I been to a doctor or ER with a virulent disease, they would immediately have asked where i had
been. With whom. and for what duration. With that information. epidemiologists can notify and test those

This manual contact tracking process is workload intensive. calendar-day wasting. data-poor. and
inaccurate.

"Location tracking" can provide the raw data needed to identify potential contacts automatically. early. and
thoroughly. from information routinely collected by network providers.

The location. at a date and time. ofa vast number of anonymous cell phones, over the preceding two

Dear Tony,

I hope that all is well given our current circumstances. I am sure you are very busy, so apologize forthe
intrusion, but would love your insight if you have a moment.

Ijust had a very Interesting talktoday with Wendy Ginsberg on the House Committee on Oversight and
Reform, with an opportunity to testify at a hearing next Wednesday (email attached).

While I am very excited for an opportunity to advocate for further funding and operational support for
pandemic preparedness, I also recognize that this format may not be the right one to do so: Moreover, I
may not be the right person to do so, as I think you, Francis, or Eric Lander would do far better than

me.

I imagine they have already asked you to participate, and would just love any Insight you might have as
to whether I should consider domg this, and if so, how I should proceed. I really only would want to do
so if it is a place where I can help the larger infectiousdisease community and make a positive
nonpolitical impact:

Thanks so much for your consideration,

Pardis

Richard Preston pointed me in your direction, saying you would be the right person to help me think
through a potential hearing on codifying the global health security team on the National Security
Council.

The hearing (as of right now in my mind) would

1. Examine the lessons learned from the Ebola and other previous outbreaks about how federal
government design and operations can facilitate or hinder global health and stemming
pandemics;

2. Analyze how eliminating the global health security team has put us several steps behind where
we need to be in ﬁghting coronavirus; and

3. Argue for :odifying the team and its leadership as part of the larger national security apparatus
and avoid kowtowing to outbreak fatigue.

I’m hoping you might be willing to speak with me about your expertise and thoughts in this area. I'm
deﬁnitely not the expert and i would love someone with your background to ensure I’m getting this
story right— and that l have the right people at the witness stand to tell it.

Would you have time to talk today orsome time very soon? We are hoping to have this hearing next
week,

Vours,

Subject: Great advice from Chinese expert
Dear Dr. Fauci,

Dr. Wenhong Zhang, has become very famous in China’s war against COVID-lg because of his
great excellence in anti-virus. Dr. Zhang is the Director of the Infectious Disease Department of
I‘Iuashan Hospital in Shanghai. He is very good according to my observation all long Another
great doctor in China is Dr. Nanshan Zhong.

According to Dr. Zhang’s Video at https://www.thcgaper.cn/uewsDctail forward 6537248.
COVIDJ‘) can really be prevented with 3 key measures. i.e. to keep social distancing, wash
hands frequently and wear masks. I strongly suggest American people should wear masks like
Chinese, South Korean people, etc., because even China's highest leader, Mr. Jinping Xi, wears
masks. If it is difﬁcult for all the US people to do this now, I suggest working staff in airports,
supermarkets and other public places should wear masks ﬁrstly In order to avoid crossing
infection.

Further. Dr. Zhang said, if a person is still infected though he/she takes the above 3 measures
carefully, the person must be infected by his/her family members. So I propose the concentrated
isolation ofmild confirmed cases should be considered as I advised yesterday.

I strongly suggest American government should leam precious experience of anti-COVID-i9
from and cooperate with the mainland China. Taiwan, South Korea with an open mind. If you
need any help to contact with Dr. Zhang. I will do what Ican.

I am very conﬁdent that the US government will lead American people to win the anti-COVID—
19 war by you and other great experts. Science, expertise and great learning are best medicines.

God bless you! God bless America. China and the whole world!

Dear Dr, Fauci.

My name is Michael Lin. My family are living in __ @197 now. I have been following
spread of COVlD-19 (Corona Virus) closely because such VIl‘llS is very contagious and
dangerous,

lfa person is mildly sick with COVID-l9, the CDC now suggests the person should “stay home

except to get medical care . i,e. home-isolation, according to
httos://www.cdc.uov/coronavrrus/ZO | 9-11cov/downloads/Sick—With-ZOl 9-nCoV-fact-shectpdf

However. the home isolation may result in family spread of COVID~19 in certain kinds of
families, egi, parents are infected but their kids are too young to take care of them, adults are
infected but their parents are too old and risky to look after them (if they live together), an old
husband/wile is infected but the spouse is too vulnerable to take care of him/her, etc. In such
scenarios, the home isolation may increase family spread and even community spread risks in the
US.

A great method to avoid home-isolation risks is the concentrated isolation, i.e. to isolate
mild symptomatic people in a concentrated place instead of their hurries.

 

The concentrated isolation can avoid the above family spread risks. provide professional medical
help to isolated people, reduce mental pressure of other family members. etc. so that it can
reduce community spread risks, Such method has been proved to be effective by China’s war
against COVID» l 9.

The concentrated place can be a hotel, university dorm building, etc.. which should be easily
managed for medical surveillance.

The concentration isolation may be voluntarily chosen by relevant families at the beginning, and
adjusted to apply subject to different conditions

Hope the above advice helpful!

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I am a postdoc researcher working at LSU health sciences center In New Orleans. I would like to
communicate my concern about the COVID19 in the US.

I am Italian and my partner is Chinese and we have been carefully following the COVIDlS
spread first in China and now in Italy and Europe. Based on my scientific and personal
knowledge I am confident to say that the US is only few weeks ahead of What is happening in
Italy now and this could only be stopped if strict measures will be taken in the entire country as
soon as possible.

If you have the power, I ask you to please try to convince the government to apply such
measures, even if this means to shut down the entire country for some weeks. I know that the
economy and money interests are what often prevents to take such decision, but in this case
we are talking about life and death and we cannot risk this high price.

We have a very clear example of how severe the COVID19 can be if we do not act on time and
this is unfortunately my country at this time, We also have a good example, China, in which
very aggressive measures have been applied and, despite some delay in their application at
first, they now have reached a strong regression in the virus spread and they gradually can
restart the country. China measures were to close every city borders, close working places and
every non essential activity. They asked the population to stay at home and go out only forfood
and health emergencies, I thinkthis is what we should do in US too.

A recent study from Italy in which they tested every person in one Italian city showed that the
50-70% of the people positive for the virus were asymptomatic. This is such an important
information that tells usthe only way to prevent the spread is to prevent the people from
moving because we cannot really know who is caring the virus. Also, screening is important and
should be ideally extended to everyone. https:[{www.repubblica.itlsalutelmedicine—e»

My lab is based in New Orleans where the number of COVlD19 cases is now growing fast.
However, there is no sign from the university or my institute to close. We are working as usual
with only some mild restrictions even if we have colleagues that are at home sick. or worse,
that showed up at work coughing. The city mayor applied some restrictions but the people are
still celebrating events on the street. Up to today we were acknowledged that we have a
presumptive positive case in the building where we live. We are doing what we can as
responsible individuals but tomorrow we will go to work again not knowing if we are spreading
the virus.

I thank you for reading this email and l hope my arguments are solid and accurate enough to
encourage you to take action.

These research papers show great antiviral promise for both Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine. The
Chinese have started using them. So should we. The antiviral effects were originally discovered in Europe
during SARS. but then forgotten about as SARS was so aggressive it killed the host too quickly and died
out. French Prof Raoult and others have helped the Chinese advising them to proceed in this way and they
had the good sense to trial it.

Unlike vaccines and costly new nntivirals, Hydroxychlumqrrine and Chloroquine are generally safeV very

Dear Dr. Fauci,

My name is Viming and i am a clinical fellow in rheumatology at NIH/NIAMS. I have
Colleagues and friends working in community hospitals fighting against COVID—lQ and we
are deeply concerned regardingthe CDC interim recommendations forCOVIDrlg
prevention in healthcare settings saying that ”facemasksare an acceptable alternative
when the supply chain of respirators cannot meet the demand". Currently hospitals in New
York City are asking their healthcare providers to wear surgical mask while treating COVID-
19

COVlDAIQ is highlycontagious in healthcare settings with a large proportion of healthcare
professionals being infected reported in early literature [1]. A recent study suggested that
asymptomatic patients can transmit SARSrCoVJ which puts potentially additional threats
to healthcare providers [2].

Although surgical mask can effectively prevent droplet transmission, whether and to what
degree SARS-CoV-Z can transmit through aerosol approach is still uncertain. Studies with
2003 SAKS virus suggest a high level of concerns foraerosol transmission [3], and a recent
unpublished study from medium revealed that SARS-CoVAZ has similar aerosol stability
compared to SARS [4].

Healthcare professionals are our frontline force against the coronavirus emergency and we
cannot afford even a slight probability of a large scale infections among healthcare workers
due to insufficient personal protective equipment We hope thataccessing the Strategic
National Stockpile (5N5) and any potential mass production program are actively being
considered to protect, and ultimately, save lives for U5. people.

Algorithm for addressing people with mild upper respiratory
symptoms in the age of Covid-l 9,

Hi Tony,
Thank you so much for calling me this morning, and for your terrific help last night trying to
think through the

Given ourdiscusslon this morning, I think it would be very helpful if the task force on
coronavirus came up with a clear algorithm for addressing issues related to people having
symptoms that could be from a cold, flu, or other virus » and not related to the virus that
causes COVID-19,
Let’s say there’s a hypothetical patient with some combination of sore throat, aches and
pain, low grade fever in the 99's by mouth, and cough; there’s no shortness of breath. Let’s
say they are now proactively self—quarantined at home and are in the process of
evaluation. Questions include:
1‘ Who. ifany, of the person’s contacts within the previous days should be
contacted?
2‘ If it’s only "close contacts" — those who were within 6 feet ofthe person for an
extended period oftlrne:

3. What's the definition of extended period of time?

b, Does any physical touching— such as a hug or handshake— immediately
mean there is significant contact?

c. How far backfrom the onset of the person's illness do we need to check
for “close contacts?" This gets to the issue of how long before symptoms
begin can asymptomaticshedding occur.

3. if no Covid-19 testing is available or the person has been told they are not sick
enough for testing: how do we think about the potential risk to that person’s
contacts, for example, at home or work?

NIH Production to ICAN_001551 "mam“

4. if Covid-19 testing is available: before the result is back, what is the advice for a
corporation or other entity where the person being tested may have infected
others through asymptomatic shedding of virus? Should the possible exposure,
even if relatively ”low risk", set offany protocol that deals with trying to minimize
possible spread ofthe virus?

Obviously, there are many other specific questions.—

hi sir,

currently an effective vaccine for covid—19 appears 12»! 6 months away in View of
rampant spread of disease , we can use the cow pox—small pox idea to minimize the
disease mortality.

if general population at large was purposefully infected with human coronavims
strains which classically cause mild URTI‘s , the chances of them getting infected or
more probably getting severely ill with covid-19 would be deﬁnitely reduced, we do
not need [D make a vaccine of these strains — classically they cause mild, self-

we have these resources and can do this in a very short period.

OMB is putting a hoid on sending HHS witnesses to the Hill through the end of March. This
will Indefinitely postpone our budget hearing.

Thanks for your patience,
Adrienne

 

Dear Agency Legislative Affairs Teams:

Due to the full Administration mobilization underway. we are placing a temporary hold on
sending up government witnesses who are engaged in the coronavirus response, The
Executive Branch needs all of iis resources directly focused on executing its day-tn-day
response to coronavirus We will continue to practice ”radical transparency" with Congress

NIH Production to ICAN_001555 "mm

and the American people, but participation in hearings cannot continue to divert resources
from our response effort.

This pause is effective immediately It is intended to last for three weeks through the end
of March, though we will reevaluate if it needs to be extended at a later date,

Importantly, as noted above, this does not only include witnesses for hearings thatare
explicitly focused on coronavirus, but also, to be determined on a caseibyrcase basis,
witnesses and agencies who are playing vital roles on the Task Force or the broader
Administration response, whether or not the hearing topic is coronavirus.

Therefore, please do not accept hearing invitations from Congress for hearings through
March if you believe they meet the above criteria, If you already have hearings conﬁrmed
that you believe fits this criteria, please notify us immediately, You will likely have to
postpone those hearings,

Four corners leadership offices have already been notified ofthis policy.

Please reach out to OMB ifvou have any questions, and we will be happy to work with you
as we implement this policy.

Firsl,, allow me to thank and congratulate you for telling the govemmenl, and the

unpreparednem for the coronavirus spread. But while we wait for Big Pharma to
develop a vaccine for this

disease. there is something that could be done NOW to prevent the spread of the
virus . and it wouldn‘t

cost the government anythingl Allow me to explain

Decades ago, when I was 21 designer in Aerospace, and look my drawings up to the
blueprint room for copies,

1 would always notice the 'aroma’ ot‘amrnonia in the mom, Inquiring about the
safety of this constant exposure

by the blueprinting staffl was told that there are three groups ofpeople who don't
get colds: 1) those working

in salt mines, 2) those working in sewers, and 3) those working in blueprint rooms!
A few decades later I was

advised. by wt MD, that the way to avoid colds is to keep saucers ofhousehold
ammonia in my house rooms

(and in the ofﬁce rooms, it'allowed), and that one would not even notice the smell
after a few days. Since cold

virus transmission is by aerosol particles from the already-infected. and the dilute
ammonia fumes are able to

NIH Production to ICAN_001557 "mum

'inactivate' them, might these ammonia l'umes be able to protect us against the
coronavirus?

Admittedly, too much ammonia gas can be very irritating (and even fatal, as in
WWI), but evidently people

seem to survtve and thnve at the just-noticeable gas levels being recommended here.
If there is some potential

lung damage from ammonia gas. that might be prevented by taking (freeze-dried)
stinging nettles leaf, a widely

recognized lung—cleaning supplement that is recommended by Naturopathic
Doctors But it would seem that

the potential beneﬁts oflimiting the spread of the coronavirus in our entire
population for outweighs the risks

of lung damage. Since most homes already have bottles of ammonia (in their
laundry area), this preventive

strategy could be implemented immediately, and would provide the public with
the satisfaction of feeling

they are doing 'their part‘ in combatting this pandemic ...a.nd protecting themselves
and their loved—ones.

Here is my idea: Doctors need to utilize methods that endurance athletes have used
in the past to increase their red blood cells in order to increase their body‘s
blund-uxygen carrying capacity.

Further description:

Athletes like Lance Armstrong used blood doping and other ways to increase their
Erythropoietin (EPO), This was called cheating in sports. However, the results
gave him an advantage because his body could get more (VO»2 max) oxygen with a
single breath compared to others This helped Armstrong to become more "super
human.” I agree that this should be illegal in spons. However. I think it would be
great ifa person was ﬁghting for their life to be super human.

There are natural ways to increase your EPO and there are drugs to trick your body
into producing more EPO. One of the best natural ways is high altitude training
(think Boulder, CO and Kenya marathon runners). Also, the risks involved in
increased red blood cell count obviously include stroke, blood clot, heart attack and
many others. But I think that ifmonitored closely and as a last resort this method
might help some people to survive this outbreak.

From 1996 until his retirement in 2006. Dr. Bill worked full-time as Director of
Research & Development at Hammer Nutrition. Among his many accomplishments,

Medicine Practitioner and the author of"What Should I Eat? A Food-Endowed

What is EPO?

Erythropoietin (EPO) is a naturally occun'ing hormone that stimulates the
production ofred blood cells (REC). Erythlopoietin is a glycoprotein hon-none
produced in the kidneys. containing a 165»amino acids structure. Most
erythropoietin is produced by the kidneys renal cortex, but some is also produced in
the liver (mainly in the fetus). the brain and uterus.

Why is it imponant?
Erytlnopoietin production is stimulated by low oxygen levels in interstitial cells of

the perirubular capillaries in the kidneys. Following its production in the kidneys.
EPO travels to the bone marrow where it stimulates production ofred blood cells

NIH Production to ICAN_001565 "'Hmu‘m

(RBC's) [2], EP0 increases the body's blood-oxygen carrying capacity, but only up
to a point. An overabundance may compromise health and hinder blood ﬂow
dynamics with performance-limiting implications In the absence of EPO, only a
few RBC's are fon'ned by the bone marrow,

Why are RBC's important?

Red blood cells carry iron-rich hemoglobin for up to 120-days, then they die. Unless
there is a continual supply of iron, Vitamin 15-12, Vitamin C and l-olacin, anemia
and reduced oxygen carrying capacity manifests in two ways:

Low red blood cell count
Malformed red blood cells.

How can one increase their oxygen carrying capacity?

There is a distinct difference between unethical, harmful, EPO—blood doping
methods and the safe nutrition that effectively increases individual oxygen-carrying
capacity. Once can improve their health and oxygen carrying capacity similar to
EPO without compromising the athlete's health or integrity. EPO levels up to 48%
safely improve performance in males, however beyond this level, the risk of
compromised health increases. Look to dietary suggestions below regarding
vitamins, minerals, proteins, and avoiding anemia to ensure oxygen carrying
capacity.

Can excess EPO can be lethal?

Yes. The margin between effective and lethal quantities of EPO is very narrow, EPO
use can be Lh'l'l—lAL. Many athletes seeking to derive its perfonnance—enhancmg
effects have died from incorrectly-administered EPO. Inappropriate use of
exogenous EPO can cause elevated hematocrit levels (i.e. thickened blood that is
difﬁcult to pump). Elevated EPO increases the risk of heart attack due to the
increase in hematocrit. Choosing sustainable, healthy choices is preferred

Exogenous EPO is totally cleared from the urine within 48 hours of its
administration and is cleared from the blood within 72 hours of its administration
but its physiological effects prevail for several monthslﬂ] A look at EPO'S complex
pathway further illustrates a complex physiological process below, see
PATHWAYS[4]. Research followed over 7,000 middle-aged men for more than 12
years, and discovered that the risk of diabetes increases proportionate to hematoerit
increase.[l9] [20], Men with hematocrits above 48 percent have a 400% increased
risk of non—insulin-dependent-diabetes mellitus. The upper recommended levels for
a female is slightly lower at 45%.

This nutritional intervention parallels exercise intensitys effect for increasing FPO.
Nutritional and training interventions for resolving low EPO levels during iron

NIH Production to ICAN_001566

supplementation (only prescribed by a physician who should monitored progress)
should not be permitted above a reference range of 48% in males and 45% in
females. Similar research conﬁrms this report.[21] [22] [23]

Does exercise intensity increase EPO'.’

It's complicated. Roberts & Smith measured the effects ofexercise-induced hypoxia
on the physiological production ot‘erythropoietin. Twenty athletes exercised for 3
min at 106—1 12% maximal oxygen consumption. The fitness of these athletes
provrdes a physiological environment for increasing EPO naturally from short 3-
minute all-out intervals. Estimated oxyhemoglobin saturation was measured by
reﬂective probe pulse oximetry (Nellcor N200) and was validated against arterial
oxyhemoglobin saturation by COeoximetry in eight athletes. Serum erythropoietin
concentrations. as measured using the INCSTAR Epo-Trac radioimmunoassay,
increased signiﬁcantly by l9~37°u at 24 hours post-exercise in 11 participants who
also had an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation < or : 91%, Decreased territin levels
and increased reticulocyte counts were observed at 96 hours post-exercise. However,
no signiﬁcant changes in EPO levels were observed in nine non-desaturating
athletes and eight non-exercise controls. Good agreement was shown between
arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation and percent estimated oxyhaemoglobin saturation
(limits ofagreement : -3.9 to 3.7, They concluded that a short 3 minutes
supramaximal exercise period could induce both hypoxemia and increased
erythroporetin levels in well-trained individuals. The decline of arterial hypoxemia
levels below 91% during exercise appears to be necessary for the exercise-induced
elevation of serum erythropoietin levels. Furthermore, reﬂective probe pulse
oximetry was found to be a valid predictor ofpercent arterial oxyhemoglobin
saturation during supramaximal exercise when percent estimated oxyhemoglobin
saturation > or : 86" o.[9]

What naturally occuring, nutritional building blocks aid in EPO production?

Protein adequacy is a factor in erythropoietin (EPO) production. Inadequate protein
nutrition can reduce the EPO produced. The erythroid response to Erythropoietin
(EPO) is highly dependent on dietary protein adequacy and quality. The mouse
spleen is an erythropoietie organ, which contains an EPO-responsive cell population
that can be eastly ampliﬁed by administration of the hormone. Researchers
determined the effect of a protein-free diet offered freely to mice up to two days
after injection ofr-Hu EPO (1000mU/200 ul) on the response ofthe above
population. Splenic cell suspensrons from control and experimental mice were
prepared in microwells containing 400 mU r-Hu EPO and appropriate medium. The
response to EPO was evaluated in terms of3H—thymidine uptake. The results
obtained indicate that acutely induced protein restriction suppressed the response of
the EPO-responsive splenic cell population to EPO when it was imposed on mice
immediately after hormone injection. and suggest the appearance of deficient rates
ofdifferentiation nferythmpoietic units by protein restriction [l I] Adequate dietary
protein intake is 1.4-1.7 grams/kilogram body weight per day for an endurance

NIH Production to ICAN_001567

athlete,

What other nutritional elements and processes affect the natural production of EPO
and the body‘s oxygen carrying capacity?

Dietary Iron. To ensure oxygen carrying capacity, one should take the recommended
daily value of iron. Food sources of iron are red meat, liver. and egg yolks. Most
flour. bread, and cereals are iron-fortiﬁed, If the diet continues to be iron-deﬁcient,
only a physicran should prescribe and supervise iron supplementation.

Calories. Calories are needed for EPO production Calorie sufﬁciency (in spite of
exercise expense) is required for optimal EPO—release. Iftraining is causing weight
loss. then EPO loss may be occurring In order to test the hypothesis that the early
cessation of erythroporetin (Ep) production during hypobaric hypoxia is induced by
lowered food intake, researchers compared the plasma Ep titer of rats after exposure
to continuous hypoxia (426 kPa : 7000 m altitude) for 4 days in fed or fasted rats
after exposure to discontinuous hypoxia. They found that plasma Ep was rather low
after 4 days of continuous hypoxia Their ﬁndings showed that fasting lowers the
EPO-response to hypoxia in normal rats [12].

Hormone and Glucose. EPO production also has hormonal-dependant roots
complexly related to glucose metabolism, and calorie adequacy. The effect of
Thyroid-T3 replacement and glucose supplementation on erythropoietin production
was investigated in fasted hypoxic rats. It was found that 48 hr of fasting
signiﬁmntly reduced the circulating levels of thyroid hormones and the production
ofrenal and extrarenal erythropoietin in response to hypoxia. These effects of
fasting were completely abolished when the animals had free access to 25% glucose
solution as drinking water, despite their lack of protein intake, Replacement doses of
'1'} (05 micrograms/ 100 gm per day) restored erythropoietin production in the fasted
animals but also increased the response of the fed controls. To avoid the effect of
endogenous T3, the experiments were repeated in thyroidectomized rats. EPO
production in athyroid rats was found to be markedly decreased, with values
equivalent to those found in normal fasted animals, and were not affected by fasting
or glucose supplementation. Replacement doses of T3 increased EPO production in
all three groups, but the fasted animals needed ﬁve times as much T3 to obtain a
response similar to that observed in the fed group, Glucose supplementation
enhanced the effect ofT} in the fasted animals but did not completely restore them.
These results indicate that caloric deprivation is primarily responsible for the
decreased EPO production induced by fasting and that this effect is probably
mediated by both a decreased level of T3 and a decreased responsiveness to it.[13]
A calorie deﬁcit therefore requires 500% more Thyroid Hormone (T3) to maintain
EPO levels. This is a good reason for monitoring calorie intake during high training
calorie expense.

Iron absorhtion Dietary interventions signiﬁcantly advance nonheme iron
absorption rate during EPO production. It is very important to include foods to

NIH Production to ICAN_001568

enhance nonheme iron absorption, especially when an exercise-induced iron loss is
high or when no heme iron is consumed, such as in a vegetarian diet. Absorption of
heme iron is very efﬁcient; the presence of red meat increases absorption of non-
heme iron +400%. Only 1-7% of the nonheme iron in vegetable staples in rice.
maize, black beans, soybeans, and wheat are absorbed consumed alone. Vitamin C
improves the rate ofabsorption ofnonheme iron from red meats. Diets that include a
minimum of5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily provide adequate vitamin C to
boost nonheme iron absorption, Calcium, polyphenols, tannins from tea, and
phytates (a component oiplant foods), rice, and grains inhibit the absorption of
nonheme iron. Some of the protein found in soybeans inhibits nonheme iron
absorption. Most healthy individuals maintain normal iron stores when the diet
provides a wide variety of foods. However, ifthe diet contains large amounts of
oxalates and phytates from dark green leafy vegetables and whole cereal grains the
absorption of iron decreases due to binding with iron in the gut. High absorption of
heme iron is further advanced by foods containing Vitamin C in an acid environment
found of the stomach, The recommended for daily iron intake is between 10—1 8
milligrams for adult males and postmenopausal females. Most endurance athletes
consume too much iron. Iron is added to breads, cereals, and most packaged foods.

From a computer-generated dietary analysis on 16 endurance athletes and 9 non-
alhleles, iron intake from their reported food inlake was assessed,

The results of this data is as follows:
GROUP

PERCENT DAILY IRON (RBI/RDA)
MALE ENDURANCE A'l'HLE ['11
279%

FEMALE ENDURANCE ATHLETE
193%

MALE SEDENTARY

158%

FEMALE SEDENTARY

115%

What are some food combinations that increase the ahsnrtinn of iron?

NIH Production to ICAN_001569

How foods are combined may affect iron absorption rate, Excess iron overdose is
unhealthy and should be avoided. Common side effects of acute iron overload are
gastro-intestinal pain, constipation, nausea, and heartburn. Excess iron levels may
generate a continuous low-grade infection. Foods are the best source of iron. The
best food source of iron is liver and red meats. These foods contain heme iron,
which is better absorbed than non-heme iron. Non-heme iron can be found in dark
green, leafy vegetables (spinach. chard and kale) and whole cereal grains (bran and
whole wheat bread). Include dark green, leafy vegetables and Whole cereal grains in
the daily diet. Oxalates and phytates found in dark green leafy vegetables and whole
cereal grains decrease the absorption of iron because they bind with iron in the
gastrointestinal tract. Iron fortiﬁed cereals increase iron from the diet. Anemia may
develop on a meat-free diet and/or ifthe iron store or intake is low.

Red meat contains arachidonic acid, an EPO-piecursor nutrient, but it also contains
high levels of saturated fats and cholesterol suggesting a little (now and then) is
good but too much will harmfully compromise cardiovascular lipid levels, Adding
iron to the diet in supplemental form is not recommended except under the
supervision of a physician who is monitoring blood serum levels for a speciﬁc
outcome. It has been shown that eating red meat 1-2 per week may contribute to
provtding substrates known to regenerate EPO as shown in animal research. The
ability of Arachidonic Acid (AA), the bisenoic prostaglandin precursor to stimulate
erythroporesis and Erythropoietin (EP) Production in exhypoxte polycythemic mice
and the programmed isolated perfused canine kidney was found to stimulate
erythropoiesis when administered to exhypoxic polyeythemic mice in the lowest
dose tested (50 microgram/kg i.p.). Endogenously synthesized prostaglandins, their
intermediates and/or other products of AA metabolism, such as prostaeyclin and
prostaglandins play an important role in the control EPO production.[l4] Ilematocrit
levels are restored through the supplying dietary or supplemental speciﬁc substrates
to support the body‘s natural bl’O-producing mechanisms during endurance exercise
stress.

More Dietary Recommendations

There is a method to improve iron uptake in the absence of oxalate or phytate rich
foods previously mentioned above. If hematocrit, hemoglobin. or tenitin blood lab
measures are low. the athlete may add l-gram ofVitamin C to a 5—4 ounce lean cut
of red meat cooked in an iron skillet one to two times each week. A complete dietary
protocol for cancer patients going through chemotherapy and radiation was
published and is applicable to over—trained endurance athletes who present low
hematocrit levels.[16]

Conclusion

In normal adults. the kidneys produce EPO, which initiates approximately 90% of
natural erythropoietin production. Tissue oxygenation exposure regulates the
production ofeiythropoietiu. Less oxygen saturation in the air we inhale (either by
altitude or hypoxic interval training) stimulates the kidneys to activate the chemical
messengers to instruct the bone marrow to increase the production of EPO to resolve
the lack of oxygen exposure. Hypoxia or Anemia stimulates the kidney production
of erythropoietin to increase production red blood cells. EPO released from the
kidneys increases the rate of red blood cell division and differentiation ot‘specitic
cells in the bone marrow

Dietary deficiency of specific foods and nu'ci‘onutrients. hormone imbalance, and
lack of speciﬁc hypoxtc training stress inhibit the endogenous (natural) production
oflz‘l’O. Additionally, nutritional imbalance from caloric restriction (or exercrse
related expense), dehydration. fluid intoxication, excess calcium, excess inositol,
excess oxalates foods. excess phytic acid from cereal grains. or a lack of hypoxic
interval training all inhibit the natural production ot‘EPO also. [17] [18],

Manipulating diet for protein and total calorie adequacy, monitoring hydration,
using supplements, timing food combinations, adding weekly hypoxic exercise
followed by easy or rest days all increases the release ofnatural EPO for healthy
maximal oxygen carrying capacity. Plus. there are many ways to use diet and
wellness to ensure that the body‘s production of red blood cells is sound and that
their oxygen carrying capacity is functioning.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you very much for courageous and tireless efforts to defeat
the coronavirus pandemicr

One of the statements attributed to you puzzled me.

The article

Dr. Anthony Fauci Says He Would Like a 'Dramatic' Reduction of
Personal Interactions at Social Gatherings to Fight Coronavirus, by

https://www.newsweek.com/dr—anthony-fauci-sayshe-would-like-dramatic—

quotes you as saying,
"We said many times If you just leave italone and left the virus to its own
devices then it‘ll go way up and it'll come down naturally over a period of

several weeks," Fauci said. "Unfortunately for our colleagues in Italy. in
France, and certainly in China, that's what happened“

NIH Production to ICAN_001574 "mm

Question: Is the implication that the virus would have stopped spreading
rapidly in China even if their government had not instituted drastic measures

to curtail the epidemic?

Put another way: Is it not correct that the drastic measures implemented by
the Chinese government were very helpful in halting the spread ofthe vims in
China?

from yet another angle: is it correct that the public health measures adopted in
South Korea and Taiwan have proved very effective in controlling the spread of the
epidemic?

Thank you very much again for your hard work,
Martin

I ask you to address the explosion ofeoncerns among the dental community in
regards to COVID-l9. We. the dental community, already high risk personnel, are at
an even higher risk at this point and time. Many ofthose who do not work in the
dental community are not aware ofhow high risk our current situation is. For 8-12
hours a day we are creating aerosols while sitting 842 inches from a persons open
mouth. These aerosols contain saliva and blood droplets, along with billions of other
bacteria and materials. In dentistry, saliva is considered a blood borne pathogen.
Although OSHA requires Level 3 masks for all aerosol producing procedures, not
all ofﬁces are complying. This DOES NOT matter anyway as we know SURGICAL
MASKS DO NOT FILTER OUT THE COVID—l9 virus, I ask that you suspend non
essential dental procedures such as dental cleanings and other procedures that are
non-emergent. That we triage patients and accept EMERGENCIES ONLY. We are
at such a HIGH risk, not only to ourselves and our families, but 3 HIGH RlSK to
spreading this virus COMMUNITY wide. Many of us are taking extra precautions
but screening patients. but with a up-to- 14 day incubation period. that obviously
does not matter,

Please hear our plea to address our concerns. The American Dental Association and
the American Dental Hygienists Association has failed us.

Thank you

Hi Dr. Fauci —good evening. i represent TytoCare, a company that built the industry's ﬁrst and only allr
in—one medical device that pairs with a virtual exam, going beyond the means of audio and Visual.
TytoHome, an OTC and FDA approved/cleared device is meant to either synchronously or
asynchronously examine a patient with capabilities to capture heart/Iung/gastmintestinal sounds,
ear/throat/skin exams, and temperature.

Due to the outbreak of COVID»19, Tyto has experienced an influx of orders worldwide to support those
that need to be monitored when quarantined. i would like to offer Tyto's assistance herein the U.S. and
thinkthrough ways and opportunities thatthe product can make a difference.

Please see a few a couple of examples on how Tvto is making a difference below:

. Patient Quarantine/Discharge at Home
0 Design: patients receive TytoHome or have it delivered for remote evaluation by infectious
disease specialists

I Example: Home Admission Service with TytoCare
. Create & manage quarantine locations, ausite or offsite

0 Setup: Patients doa self-exam with TytoCIinic while a prowder evaluates them from a
distance
I Patient is remotely guided to fully disinfect the device and station before it's
returned to staff for a second round disinfection
I Example: Nursing Home Triage

Thank you for all that you do during this difficulttime.

Thanks,
David

Thank you for your frank speaking about COVIDJQ. | credit your willingness to stand up and
speak aloud that "the emperor has no clothes” Vou have already helped so many through
the current pandemic. i know you will understand my concern. But, please help mespread this
message as well.

In light of public school closures...these include children and voung people from kindergarten
through high school. These closures also include preschool programs (Voluntary PrevK in
Florida) for Aryeaerlds that are part of a public elementary school.

These school closures do not apply to children whose ages range from infants through
preschool (including VPK) receiving care and education in private, corporate, or faithrbaseel
centers. My center is one of these, and we are not closing.

This is a business decision.
No ltids : No money.
At what price?

We have more than 90 infants, toddlers and young children enrolled at our center, with ZD»p|us
employees on premises throughout the day between the hours of 6:30 am and 6:00 pm. Ours
is a SvStar rated, NAEVC accredited preschool program. I have 17 three-year-old preschool
children in my classroom on any given day, with 3 teachers assigned to this room. This is a high
quality program.

Please explain howl am supposed to take recommended precautions against COVID~19?
Does social distance apply only to adults? If not, please help me know how to maintain social
distance of 3 feet between children and adults at arrival or departure times when lam helping

a child with separation from thelr primary care giver or saying goodbye at the end of the day?
How do I maintain social distance between children during center time in the block area, in the

NIH Production to ICAN_001596 "mum

dramatic play area, in the classroom library or computer center, during story time or music
circle? Our 3 table surfaces are used for multiple activities through the day including meals—
and they seat six mildren at each table. Friday afternoon, I had 9 children sharing space and
materials engaged in cooperative play for an extended period outside in a sandbox that
measures 5'110'...you do the math. Our spacing for cots at nap time is considerably less than 3
feet.

We have no hot water in our classroom for hand washing for children or staff which is
considered a safety measure. We are relentless in our efforts to teach hygiene to 3-year-old
children who cough, sneeze, vomit upon (and occasionally may spit, bite or lick) each other or a
staff member. We work to teach them to use a tissue instead of their hand/arm/shirt to wipe a
runny nose., hen throw it in the trash and wash their hands again. Believe me when I say a
determined child can sing "Happy Birthday" twice in an amazingly short time—deﬁnitely less
than 20 seconds-all the while whipping through instructions to wash the tops, bottoms and
ﬁngers of their hands while they sing. Hand washing is monitored by 3 adults through the day
to ensure it happens after each cough, sneeze, nose wipe and use of the bathroom. Hands are
washed after sensory play indoors or out, before am snack, lunch, and pm snacks (and
sometimes during), and when we transition from outside play. At a minimum, these 17 children
are taking turns washing hands (at our single sink) six times during a full day at preschool—
before we add in those runny noses, coughs or sneezes.

Avoid touching shared objects seriously? We work daily to teach these 3—year-old: to share
materials and space. Yes, we disinfect our toys regularly and our room daily—-but that stuffed
animal may move from dramatic play to the reading nook and to a nap cot all in one day and
may be held by a different child with each move. Our families send a blanket from home for
their child to use mrough the week at nap time—along with a soft "sleep totf' if this is needed,
to sooth their child to sleep. These items are stored in the child’s open “cubby box” in the
classroom through the week, Do we know how log COVID-lB "lives" on soft surfaces?

I am convinced school closures are necessary at this time to stem community spread of COVID-
19. I understand the strain on multiple levels this will inevitably put on families to provide care
for and education of their own children for this period. But—young children an contract this
virus and can spread it even though they may not demonstrate symptoms themselves. or,
what may be dismissed as allergies or "just a cold" may not be. Young children can carry this
virus home to their family and neighborhoods iust as easily as a school age child; and, they can
certainly bring it into our centerfrom their home. How many of our children in preschool
depend upon elderly family members for their care? We have infants as young as 6 weeks old
and children through 5 years old at our center. How many young children in care are we willing
to expose? How many and which grandparents are we going to risk?

Forget sporﬁng events, museums,
concerts or even worship services»l am worried about going to work on Monday.,.and
uncertain what may happen it | stay home.

Hi Dr. Fauci -

i am reaching out as you have been doing an incredible job as part of the White
House Coronavirus Task Force. These are difficult times and you seem to provide
the most informative interviews without sending signals of panic to the American
public.

Not sure if you remember. but we were in touch years back through many executive
clinical leadership searches lconducted during my 18 years at Korn Ferry. I am
now leading the hospital/health system practice for ZRG. ZRG is an innovative
global boutique ﬁrm disrupting the traditional executive search industry.

As a result of the COVID»19 crisis, I am speaking with/interviewing many healthcare
leaders (Chief Medical Officers, Hospital CEOs. Leading Scientists, etc.) as part of
a thought leadership piece.

The topic is “Leading Through a Time of Crisis in Healthcare". I know you are
extremely busy with the task lorce. but l would very much appreciate if you have
some time for an interview/call.

As you know, strong leadership is crucial in times of crisis and we are facing
weeks/months of extremely important decisions by our healthcare leaders
nationwide.

Do you have any availability over the next few weeks to connect? I Will make myself
available to meet and/or have a Video or phone call at your convenience,

Hope to hearfrom you soon.

can anymore after seeing the photos of the international airports today
where hundreds if not thousands of people standing in line for 5-6 hours
and realizing immediately the virus transmission will explode
exponentially because of this. I strongly request:

1. Shut down the country NOW. Mobility has to be as low as
possible. We have 10 do the very best RIGHT NOW to break the
transmission chain.

2. Please talk to Dr. Zhong Nanshan (WISE LL!) , the Chiense
doctor and advisor during the coronavirus crisis. His advice and
experience would be oftremendous value for the US. now.

3. Sofar. we’ve been acting in a reactive instead ofproactive
fashion. Not anymore. People need to realize that we are entering
war time. We need to act fast, in light speed to beat the virus.

4. Healthcare workers need to most strongly protected- treat it as
airborne if needed at the hospitals and pharmacies. Supplies of
essential protective medical supplies for healthcare workers are
equally important as supplies needed for the patients. Make sure
supply chain from China is uninterrupted; and have American
companies to start making masks, ventilators etc. Plan ahead.

5. Grocery store and restaurants can potentially become a hub
too. They need to have high level of hygiene, and ideally no
contact with the customers.

6. Garbage and belongs and bodies need to be burned.

7. Safety protocol at the labs, public and private labs that have
access to the virus or experimental animals with the virus.

8. Plan ahead. Instruct patient to self-treat or be treated by family
at home. If we ever come to it, recruit and train volunteers ( how
and whom?) to help taking care of patients.

Dr. Fauci. Clock is ticking. It's a race against time. And it‘s time

Dear Mr President.

First, our great appreciation to you and your stafffor all you do every day and in

home. However. my husband. William Hall. who is a Certiﬁed General Real Estate
Appraiser, is out in the ﬁeld all day performing interior appraisals, I have reached
out to all our appraisal management companies with this question to ask their
lenders. Considering the abundance ofeaution everyone is taking and the reﬁnance
industry seeing unprecedented volume. is there any talk about lenders moving to
exterior only appraisals (and possibly following up after with an interior)? We heard
from ServiceLink, a Fidelity company, and they have not heard any word from their
national banks/lenders changing to exterior only appraisals at this time. Thank you
very much!

Dear Dr. Anthony S. Faucr.

It's critical to disinfect droplets. aerosols and surfaces continuously to prevent or reduce or
slow down the spread at COVID-19.

The best way is using UVC ultraviolet light. UVC’s wavelength is germicidal and it is capable
to inactivate coronavirus by destroying nucleic acids and

disrupting its DNA because Wavelengths between about 200nm and 300nm are strongly
absorbed by nucleic acids. The absorbed energy can result in

detects including pyrimidine dimers. These dimers can prevent replication or can prevent
the expression of necessary proteins,resulting in the death or

inactivation of the coronavirus.
Fluorescent light lamps emit ultraviolet (UV) light. including UVC ultraviolet light.

I think it's necessary to use fluorescent tube light lamps and CFL (Compact ﬂuoresoenl
lamps) lamps in hospitals. Health centers. stores. supermarkets,

elevators. public lavatory. toilets. restrooms and other public places and should always be
on 24 hours a day. 7 days a week in order to be effective.

Research has shown that Fluorescent light lamps must be installed without any glass shade
or decorative shade and should be at least 40 watts.

I hope you find the UVC-based continuous disinfection solution helpful.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely.

Dear Dr. F auci.

Many years ago. I did some research on the effect ot‘SlV Infection on the Macaque
immune response.

I have some thoughts on the current COVlD-19 spread and in general about other
virus with unknown cure or immunity vaccine,

in research, we have adhered to a scientiﬁc method necessary for the protection of
the public in the development of new technology and treatment. There are times
however when that Boyle method and philosophy should give way to Descartes
approach.

The current infection has thus far shown a predilection for causing severe illness in
men more than women and in adults over 30 sparing children from mortality.

I believe there is a reason for this and it's not because of past exposure to other
coronavirus strains. I believe it is because ofchildren being in the middle ofor
having recently completed their immunization schedule for school. These
immunizations are absolutely not providing an immunity to COVIDJ 9. BUT, they
are causing an increase in the numbers of ganuna delta t cells and NK cells. The
children are responding better to a virus with an 5.1 day median incubation period
because of the higher values cl‘gd and 11k cells. Women have a better gd and nk cell
response to the ﬂu and other viral infections which could explain why there is a
gender difference in mortality. 1 would suggest that adults update their vaccines and
especially the hep b. Interestingly, the hep viruses illicit a better gd and nk cell
response and although most Western countries require hep b for health care workers.
the immunization rate in China is only 60% which may explain the high mortality
among health care providers.

Dear D11 F auci,

I have a question which has been troubling me since we began checking people’s
temperatures. : Ihave
seen the temperature cutoff is 99.5F.

7 I
doubt very much that in screening people the question is asked them whether they
have taken a medicine for pain or for fever in the last 24 hours, I am a nurse and
many people do realize that the common pain relievers also relieve fevers. Should
We up our game and do better at screening?

You seem to be the wisest person on the government task force for the Coronavims
I hope this reaches you.

Thanks,
Kathy Quinlan

P.S. Please practice social distaneing during the White House brieﬁngetc. It is hard
to watch all of you people bunched around the President and telling the public to
stay 6 feet apart. If you do it maybe the others will follow suit,

Greetings Dr. Fauci,

As you know, we are currently experiencing a public health pandemic, Coronavirus
(COVIDrl9). lam asking that you mke a moment to listen to Fareed Zakaria’s show
that was aired today, Sunday, March 15, 2020, at

(hit 5' www cnncom shows fareedrzakanar 5). Please listen to the message
and review the attached chart that was presented on Fareed’s show. This is NOT
about politics, but instead the people. Therefore, let's call to action that the United
States of America government officials and leaders call for a mandate similar to
other countries, such as China, Italy, and Spain (i.e., now, New York 8!. Illinois) to
help reduce the spread of this virus, flatten the curve, reduce the inundation to our
healthcare system, {which is about to experience the worst morbidity and mortality
outcomes), and work to save lives.

There are too many unknowns for us to continue to go on as status quo. Let's be
public health officials and petition to mandate the US Administration to move to
action — by putting in place a Mandatory Shutdown of Movement throughout this
Country.

Currently, we have approximately (9 airports in the United States) In total chaos,
which will be another wave and spread ofthis virus. We are not proactive; instead,
we continue to react late. This is not the public health that I know and have seen
throughout the duration of my public health vocation. We have to change this
Pandemic, so let's get to work.

“try for Pubic Health Action Needed -«--*"*‘We need this
Administration/Govemment Committee to LockDown the United States of
America. This can slow down the spread of this disease, save lives, and maybe
within 30 days we can get back on our feet.

Warm and sincere regards - please push action.

Dear Dr. Fauci.
Thank you for your leadership during the current COViD-19 crisis. We're writing to ask
you to consider spearheading an additional initiative in this effort.

As you Know. one otour greatest immediate needs is an adequate supply

of ventilators for use in hospitals. We will face a severe shortage at this crucial
equipment during a surge ofCOVID»1Q hospitalizations. This will create a bottleneck
in our ability to deliver care. a situation where we have to triage who should
live and who should die, Tragically, we see this happening already in Italy

This is a situation we must avoid.

So we propose to immediately help existing tactories to increase production. to
convert other exis irig factories for the production at ventilators and to build new
factories to do so.

Some of this will take a long time to accomplish but this pandemic is also predicted
to be with us fora long time. We must stay ahead.

We should make an alt—out effort to supply our hospitals properly and quickly. We are in
a time ofwar and we must make the commensurate effort now.

We believe we have the knowledge and the resources to do such a thing.

We just need the will. and the leadership.

We‘re writing to urge you to use your position ofleaoership to make this happen.

Here is a link to NPR’s report on this crucial issue: httgszllwww.nororg/sections/health-

evidence of that? if so, maybe we should switch people off ACE inhibitors for now.

Thanks so much!

The World Health Organization has declared the Covid-19 outbreak to be a
pandemic -- ofﬁcial recognition that the virus respects no borders and now
affects masses of people in countries all over the world. And there is no
denying the world is changing, in painful ways. We see it in financial
markets, where prices are plunging -- and in supermarkets where
customers are stripping shelves bare. All driven by fear, as the number of
virus cases grows with each passing day. While we may feel powerless over
this threat, we are not. There are important things we can and must do --
and right now.

To borrow a phrase from the war on terror, the coronavirus only has to be
right once to infect us. We have to be right every time to prevent it. So, every
time you cough or sneeze, use a tissue or the crock of your arm. Every time
you think of it, wash your hands -» as frequently as you can. Even] time you
can, practice “social distancing" -- stay away from others during this
outbreak. Social distancing is now being enforced throughout our society.
Schools are closing, sporting events of every kind are being canceled. The
curtain has even come down on Broadway shows as the Great White Way
goes dark.

Despite our best efforts, it's likely many of us will eventually get infected by
the virus, since we have no immunity to it. If that's the case, you may ask,
does it really matter when we get infected? The answer is a resounding
yes! And here‘s why: slowing the spread of coronavirus -- and consequently
delaying infections -- can make an enormous difference in our ability to
handle the pandemic.

Take a look at this illustration. It appeared in the Economist and is based on
a CDC report. The blue curve shows what happens when you do nothing.
The number of infections peaks relatively quickly. This can overwhelm a
healthcare system that is not prepared to handle such a huge number of
patients. Emergency rooms and hospitals can become overloaded. We may
see shortages of medical supplies -- including protective gear and breathing
machines -- and shortages of healthcare workers, especrally if many of them
become infected. But look at the yellow curve. It shows what can happen
when you slow the epidemic. The outbreak is stretched out. And while it may
last longer, the peak number of infections is much lower, putting less stress
on the healthcare system and allowing better care for each patient. It also
gives scientists more time to develop new treatments and vaccines.

NIH Production to ICAN_001632

Is there any evidence this works? Absolutely, espeCIally when coupled with
the time-proven technique of aggressive testing to find and isolate infected
people as early as possible. In China, where there has been strict quarantine
and social distancing in the epicenter of the outbreak, new infections have
dramatically slowed. In South Korea, where health officials cleverly used
drive-through testing. we're also seeing the number of new cases slow
down. And there's a history lesson from the 1918 flu pandemic. Back then,
Philadelphia held a parade attended by several hundred thousand people.
Soon, every hospital bed in the city reportedly was filled with Sick patients.
Saint Louis, on the other hand, practiced social isolation and saw fewer
cases.

So we have work to do, and it won't be easy, because it means changing the
way we live our daily lives and how we interact with our neighbors. And we
have to start now -- when we can make the most difference.

And here‘s something we need to keep in mind. We are all in this together.
So even as we keep a distance from each other phySIcally, we need to stay
close emotionally, Social isolation is bad for your health! If ever there was a
time to call or video chat with friends and loved ones. And don‘t forget to
reach out to the elderly --who may be alone and afraid.

Demonstrating grace under pressure is easier said than done. But that is this
doctor's prescription for gelting through this. And, if we treat each other with
kindness and empathy, we will.

Subject: Tools that may help you
Tony,

It has been about 20 years since you and I talked about SARS and my model that David Williams at WHO
used. I didn’t know if your old email still worked, so l’m using the directory listing by NIH in addition I
have some ideas to share with you about the use of tools in the current war on covid-19,

Your lclose the bars' statement is righton target with what I was writing when i heard you say it. It was a
great illustration counterlntuitive to what will work. You could have more correctly said keep the bars
open only to those in theirtwentles and thirties. Five minutes later Mayor DeBlasio said everything is on
the table Including closing bars and restaurants! Below you will see me argue why there are better
approaches and this total closure approach is the wrong move. Selective participation will work in our
favor to bluntthe curve! Total closure will not work and can work against us!

In a period of two weeks demand for medical treatment can go from 50% of hospital ca pacitv to 200%
due to disease progression and binomial expansion. Vou know the math and ideas, so there’s no need to
go into them. There is a need to closely consider how available tools are being used to mitigate an
overwhelming ofthe health care system. l can tell you now that what needs to be done isn't being done
and that the road we are on now will at most postpone crossing the threshold oi100% capacity. It will
not achieve the desired result of distributing cases over a greater time period so that being
overwhelmed is avoided.

Consider the curves:

The ’without protective measures' curve is the normal distribution as modeled by the binomial
distribution. The 'with protective measures' distribution is what we want to achieve, although that
would be foreign to an experimentalist. We don't wantthe number of cases to exceed capacity as
indicated by the horizontal dotted line. If the 'protective measures' are social distancing, school closings,
entertainment/sporting cancelations, restaurant closings, and hygiene and similar uniformly applied
measures. the 'with' curve should have a shape similar to the 'without' curve,just shifted to the right,
unless there is some unpartitioned factor interaction. The flattened curve WILL NOT RESULT because
errors should be random and SAMENESS OF TREATMENT PRODUCES SAMENESS OF EFFECT, With
UNIFORM application of measures the curve after application will still exceed a height showing the
system capacity has been exceeded.

NIH Production to ICAN_001637 ”Mm-"79

We could expect to flatten the mesokurtic ‘without’ curve into the platykurtic ’with‘ curve by systematic
time staggering in the use oftl‘e protective measures and selectively applying the measures to drive
toward herd immunity. As immunity builds toward HIT (Herd lmmunityThreshold), there will be greater
and greater slowing of infections as the linkages for transmission decrease. There are two points to
consider here.

The first point is whether measures should be applied in a uniform and blanket manner. The answer is
typically no when the effect is on an existing population because the curve won't flatten. There are two
aspects of the application of measures to consider. Is the effect of the application defining the
population or is it an effect Within a defined population, In the instance of halting all airtraffic to the US
from China, the population is being defined and altered ifinflux is allowed and that would both increase
the infections and population turbulence.There would be movement away from HIT. Any measure such
as people influx, which moves the US away from HIT. is to be avoided.

School, restaurant, and sporting event closings need to be examined in relationship to their impact on
an existing, not an increasing population. The actions have many criteria to influence them, but from the
viewpoint of keeping the liealtlicdre system from becoming overwhelmed closings that are staggered,
variable, and alternating will work to increase movement toward HIT and promote flattening of the
'with' curve.

The second point to consider is whether we can move the US toward HIT by age selective application of
available measures. The answer is yes and this could provide the best tool. Susceptibility and strengths
of covid—19 infections covary with age. People less than 30 rarely have severe infections and the younger
ones may not become infected. People under 40 show a low frequency ofsevere infection. It will be
important to know if there is a large age cohort exempt from infection because that would undermine
part of the result from selective application of measures or limit the sampling age because these people
wouldn’t develop immunity, but might contribute to delaying herd effects. If they develop immunity
their contribution can be substantial and they can be kept separated from more vulnerable people until
and unless it is established that there isn’t a need

Opening night clubs, sporting events, restaurants, and other places to people in their twenties and
thirties will build immunities, break infection transmission links, and move toward HIT with little or no
risk to the people or the rest of the herd. llave admission to the venues by existing ID, like a driver’s
license With age, and have agreement that they do not mingle with vulnerable older people. Leaving the
bars open to people in their 20’s and 30’s wrll flatten the curveI

Good allernoon Sir.

Thank you for your continued vigilance in protecting the American people. Your
wise guidance regarding a temporary national lockdown may greatly help in
reducing the spread of COVID- l9.

Ifthis action were to occur it should be in phases:

Phase 1: Federal Quarantine, Effective Immediately until 4 MAY 2020 (or further
notice) » ONLY Key and Essential federal employees of all agencies (1C included)
should report to work. Everyone else is on administrative leave. While buildings are
empty. staff remaining should conduct deep cleaning (air systems, etc.) to ensure a
healthy environment when employees come back to work.

Phase 2: Federal recall: Beginning 4 MAY 2020, federal employees are called back
to work on an as-necdcd basis (indeﬁnitely) depending on how the Virus

trends, Excluding postal workers, that accounts for nearly 2 million full—time
employees. There should be a mandatory home—quarantine so people are no! out
spreading the disease.

Phase 3: Mitigation and recovery. Federal agencies need to produce mitigation
measures (crisis action plans) should something ofthis nature occur in the

Future. Federal agencies must be ready to respond in an organized manner when a
crisis occurs.

Throughout this COVlD-l‘) event, military and law enforcement must have an
increased presence to prevent mass hysteria and mob mentality. Increased military
and law enforcement presence may help enforce the home quarantine measures and
prevent looting and other crimes that tend to occur during crisis events.

The National messages may include the following:

The top priority is the safety and security ofthe people

We will make decisions based on health guidance and current conditions here and
elsewhere

We will get through this together (share resources, express kindness etc.)

We need to care for each other - It is vital it is to unite around this crisis

As a Nation, we need to come together as a community to survive this international
disaster

This health crisis is challenging each of us to make sacriﬁces and implement
changes out of the norm.

Ultimately, this crisis is not about us. It’s about our responsibility to each other.
Thank you for all you are doing during this difﬁcult time,

Dear Director Faucl.

While important stores with pharmacies (Wain-Ian, CVS, Walgreens) remain open, many
elderly folks are afraid to enter due to the mixing of young and old and the increased risk of
coronavirus exposure. 1 suggest that these stores designate certain hours for for those 60
years of age and older. Now that stores are reducing hours to clean and restock the stores
overnight. the best hours might be ﬁrst thing in the moming. For example for Walmart. the
hours designated for those 60 and over could be 6 am, to 9 am, This would reduce their
exposure to younger people who might have the virus but who are asymptomatic (or
relatively so). This same idea could be applied to grocery stores.

Hi Dr. Fauci,

Pardon the intrusion into your email. I am sure you are super busy spearheading the fight
against COVID-19, hence I will cut to the chase. Ifyour research team is looking for ideas to
manage this novel virus, perhaps you can consider adjuvant minocycline. Personally I
conducted a small proof of concept study with mlnocycline in veterans with PTSD and am now
collaborating with the San Francisco VA for a larger and definitive study. The point I am making
that minocycline has potential benefits beyond antibacteria|.. I see that there is preliminary
evidence that it can slow down viral replication.

Anyway you are the international expert and we all THANK VOU for all that you do!

Best.

Subject: Helping to mass produce more dosages of cornavirus vaccines and
antibodies at lower cost with potentially greater potency

Dear Dr. Fauci

I don't want to overburden you with a long email, so I'll try and
get to the point.

First, we have developed a gene expression system, our Cl cell
line which is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than traditional cell
lines being used by Big Phanna to manufacture recombinant
vaccines and drugs. The hyper productive Cl cells can be
grown at ﬂexible commercial scales and are proving to be the
most efﬁcient, cost effective way to produce the tens of
millions of preventative vaccines and/or antibody treatments
the world so desperately needs.

In a collaboration with Sanoﬁ. C 1 cells were developed to
produce recombinant proteins for use in manufacturing a lower

cost better performing inﬂuenza vaccine. After conducting a

NIH Production to ICAN_001665 ”Hams”

mice trial Sanoﬁ concluded that the use of our C1 platform
resulted in equal or better inﬂuenza protectiOn, using a lower
amount of vaccine that could be produced at 10-30 times
higher productivity levels.

The Original Sanoﬁ Presentation can be found at the following
link:

Swillﬂamli‘:

 

Working together we can “Keep America Safe” by helping
to address the immediate coronavirus outbreak, be better
prepared for future infectious diseases, pandemic, and
epidemic outbreaks, and leveraging this unfortunate situation to
advance biopharmaceutical manufacturing to help speed
development, lower the cost and improve the performance of

NIH—00mm}

biologic vaccines and drugs such as insulin, seasonal ﬂu and
other vaccines and antibodies to make healthcare more
accessible and affordable to patients.

I am conﬁdent that a meeting with you can be very productive
in further stimulating big pharma and other research
institutions to speed effective, low cost vaccines and antibodies
to market.

Given the severity of the current coronavirus situation, I am
prepared to make myself available for a meeting at your
convenience

Dear Dr. Fauct,

You may not remember but we have met years back when I was at Stanford University and Training
with the late Donald E Thomas to ccnsider cell therapy oleV based on the use of reduced intensity,
non-myeloablative conditioning In preparation for stem cell transplantation to induce tolerance and
then apply cell therapy with donor lymphocytes which I have proposed for consideration of treatment
of patients with HlV with secondary naiignancy.

The purpose of this email is to try and capture your attention in order to
consider a new treatment option for COVlD-19 that can be applied for
patients in need with evidence of disease with no delay Whereas many
companies focus on development ofanti-corona vaccine, I believe the more
rational approach should be to develop treatment tor COVID-iQ and then‘ if
the virus will be deleted and/orthe disease controlled or

modiﬁed, vaccination will result without the need for specific corona»specific
vaccination which is not yet available and by the time it may be available it
may no longer be relevant.

I am serving as the Medical Director of a company in Hungary and we

believe that one simple and safe experimental treatment of patients with _

I wanted to convey an idea I had with regard to the coronavirus. It
seems to me that trying to contain the virus as we are doing at
present will be futile. Since the virus can be present for many days
without a person having any symptoms, you would literally need to
test everyone at the same time to determine who has it--an
impossible task.

I have a different thought. We know that the virus is

especially dangerous for the old and/or immunosuppressed. lMO
we should be focusing all of our efforts on keeping that group from
becoming infected. To do so that group should be encouraged to
self-isolate, to limit their social interactions and other groups should
be instructed to avoid them. Sort of a reverse‘quarantine idea. All
testing would be done within those groups and all groups would also
be encouraged to continue with the hygienic suggestions they've
already received.

The problem right now is that the media has created a panic. Last
night my wife and i went to the local Whole Foods and many ofthe
shelves were empty and healthy younger people were wearing
masks.

The message is not getting out that the virus is almost solely
dangerous to the elderly and immunosuppressed. [Why aren't the
demographics being released? That in itself could calm many
people] With my suggestion, exposures to them would be
diminished, significantly reducing the number of deaths, as well as

NIH Production to ICAN_001682 ”Hams”

the potential impact on hospitals. Any person outside of that group
that was severely affected could be identiﬁed and

treated. Quarantining othenNise healthy people outside of those
groups who finally demonstrate symptoms-like the NBA players-~is
ridiculous. They are likely to get the snifﬂes and have also already
spread the virus. As long as they're not spreading it to the
endangered group we should not worry about it.

In sum, we need to isolate the vulnerable and realize that the
mortality rate for people outside of that group is likely lower than the
flu.

Of course, while this occurs we are working on finding treatments
and vaccines. But sending home workers who have next to no
likelihood of being signiﬁcantly impacted by this virus is

ridiculous. The virus hits hardest the old and infirm, two groups that
are most likely NOT to even be in the workforce!

To me, this solution is a lot simpler than what is being tried right
now and is much more likely of success. To everyone besides the
endangered group this virus is literally less dangerous than the

flu. There is no reason that anyone outside of the endangered group
should have any concern at all and we need to make that

clear. Please let me know what you think.

Sincerely.

PS. 1 ma speaking \uice teacher
If your voice is tired from the constant talking, here are 2 sasy suggestions-

l l a closed mouthed yawn (as one might dc in a boring Class) is a quick stretch and tension reliever for the entire
vocal mechanism

2) 10-20 minutes of constructiVe rest (on your back with knees bent and head on a book to keep it inline with your
spine) will put your spine into a passive traction and give your back and neck muscles :1 chance it: rest and rcleuss

I'm hearing that in many cases people have died because lhey developed pneumonia due [a

Dear Dr Fanci (Tony),

You may remember me from the early 90‘s as I was the inventor of ncvirepine,
the ﬁrst NNRTi. We met several times at NIAID and FDA. 1 have since lumed
my scientiﬁc interests to cancer research and discovered and developed Velcade
for multiple myeloma. And I have changed career paths again, turning to
immunotherapy to treat cancer. I am currently the CEO of Gamida Cell with a
focus on cellular therapies.

One ofour programs is the expansion ol‘allogeneic NK cells. We are
collaborating with Dr JeffMiller at the University of Minnesota and are
administering 10-20 billion treshly expanded NK cells in combination with
rituximah to patients with NHL. The results are stunning with 8/1] patients

achieving CR or very goodPR with a single infusion. (see EBMT abstract
below). In addition, the safety proﬁle has been remarkably good since two thirds
of our patients have Kamofsky performance <80. (NO CR8 or Tumor lysis
syndrome or neurotoxiciiy has been observed)

 

I thank you in advance, and look forward to your response, (also copied is Dr
Simmtov, our Chiechdimil Ofﬁcer)

United States, >Gamida Cell, Jerusalem, Israel

Background: NK cells have the capacity to kill tumor targets and potential
in cancer therapy. Limitations include specificity, persistence after infusion
and how to maximize NK cell activity in vivo. We report results of a Phase 1
clinical trial of GOA-201, a cellular product composed of Natural killer (NK)
cells from healthy donors expanded exivivo with nicotinamide (NAM) and
|L715, a unique ex vivo activation strategy to induce persistence. Prior in
vitro studies and pre—clinical models demonstrated that NAM-exposed NK
cells exhibit augmented resistance against exhaustion and improved killing
function, proliferation, and organ trafficking. We report safety and
preliminary efficacy from a phase I trial of GDA-201 in patients (pts) with
relapsed or refractory (R/R) NHL or MM.

Methods: Following donor apheresis, CD37depleted mononuclear cells
were cultured for 1416 days with NAM (SmM) and lL-15 (20ng/ml),
resulting in a 40-fold increase in NK cells and increased expression of
CD62Lfrom 2.9% to 21%. GDA-201 contained ~98% NK cells, and CD3
content was maintained at <0,5% (<5x10‘/kg/dose). Pts with R/R Becell
NHL or MM received cyclophosphamide (400mg/mzlv x 3d) and
fludarabine (3O mg/mJ/d [V x 3d), followed by two doses of GDA»201
(Days 0 and 2) and low-dose IL—2 (6 million units sc). Pts with NHL or MM
received rituximab (375 mg/ml) or elotuzumab (10 mg/kg), respectively, x
3 weekly infusions to enhance NK cell targeting through antibody,
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Results: 25 pts were enrolledz11 with NHL (5 follicular, 5 diffuse large cell
lymphoma, 1 mantle cell lymphoma) and 14 with MM, in 3 cohorts of
escalating GDA7201 dose; 14 pts received the maximum target dose
(median 1.7 x109cells/kg, range 1.6-2.0 x 1OAcell5/kg). There were no dose
limiting toxicities. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia (n=2), increased
creatinine, hyponatremia, pulmonary edema; all events were trarISIent.
There were no neurotoxic events, confirmed CRS, GVHD or marrow aplasia,

One atient died of E-coli se sis.
i Median duration of response is 11 months (CR patients} and 3

months (PR patients). In MM patients, 1 patient with extramedullary
disease had CR and 4 had SD with median duration 2.5 months. In our
previous study using overnight activated NK cells, persistence 7 days after
adoptive transfer was limited. Using GDA7201, flow cytometry confirmed

NIH Production to ICAN_001700

the persistence of donor NAM-NK in peripheral blood up to day 7-10 (day
7 range 2-55% donor NK cells; Figure 1), as well as enhanced in vivo
proliferation (median Ki67 99%) In addition, the enhanced expression of
the homing receptor CD62L correlated with trafficking to bone marrow
and lymph nodes in vivo as confirmed by ﬂow cytometry of biopsied
tissues at day 4.

Conclusions: Cellular therapy using GDAVZO’I with monoclonal antibodies
was safe, and demonstrated early evidence of clinical activity in heavily
pre-treated pts with advanced NHL and MM. Laboratory studies show that
the GDA»20’l product shows better persistence, Larger phase II studies are
warranted.

prevent the spread of other contagious diseases by implementing rational public

Thanks for your hard work on Comnavirus. What we desperately need are specific metrics
(available daily to everyone) on the disease. We also need to know how to evaluate
them. When will we know if it is getting better? It is really as bad as the media would have
us believe? Please set some goals and objectives on the metrics so we know where we are
and know when we have won or lost.

Yesterday Rush Limbaugh compared this to data on the Swine Flu in 2009 (60 million cases,
275,000 hospitalizations, 12,500 deaths from your website) and suddenly the Corona virus
doesn‘t sound very bad at all. Yet we have shut down the world economy and done

You're doing a great job under terrible Circumstances so I hope you hang in there. I'm

“(now you're probably Far too busy to do yet another program with me
(HarberTV.com[Fguci) but, ifyou can send me a couple of quick answers this
morning, that would be great.

1. Do you think it's realistic we could have an effective vaccine for the COVlDAIQ
virus by this Fall? My guess is it will be more like the Fall ofzoai but tell me if
I might be wrong.

2. Given that we've known about the probability nfa pandemic, why are we so
poorly prepared to address it (e.g.. masks, testing kits, medical stalling et
ceteral? I realize most of the needs rarely occur and when they do, there are
extraordinary spikes in demand for certain products and expertise but one
would think there are ways to address this far better than we have

3. Is there anything people should know that is not being emphasized?

Thanks for any response you can send. even if it's a few words. And keep up the good
work. You are greatly appreciated

[Warning External Email]

Good morning, Howard—some answers and nonaanswers. As is the case for most answers, the
most accurate is "it depends”, but] realize that is not helpful in busy clinical settings:

No symptoms — get test positive — can you work

At this point in the pandemic, no. While we do not know what role asymptomatic infection
may play in transmission and it is plausible that someone who is NOT coughing and sneezing (or
any other respiratory droplet selfagenerating acts)is going to be less infectious than someone
who is, persons known to be infected should self-isolate. This, of course, is particularly
important for someone who has closed contact with someone at greater risk of severe illness
and health care providers.

Symptoms —test negative — can you work— or do you need 2 negatives— or the test has to be
done 2374 days after you develop symptoms

Even before COVlD-19, working while ill with a respiratory illness puts others at risk. Particularly
during when flu activity is high. Not toughing it out and going into work while sick is more
important now than ever and is an important component of social distancing—this is one of the
foundational ways that we distribute the impact of the pandemic over as long of a period as
pOSSIbIe. (We are all getting good a drawing the two pandemic curves in the air on imaginary x»
and y-axes.). One of the critical areas where we need more data is on when someone who is
infected becomes test-positive. Presumably, test-positivity would correlate with viral load in
the respiratory tract and a + would indicate greater likelihood of infectiousness. But the real
challenge ofthe return»to-work issue lies in your next question:

Test positive — back to work when — do you need negative tests — or just time - ?2 weeks after
first symptoms, first test positive.

Ah, there is the rub—currently, the recommendations vary—CDC has gone With 2 negative
swabs 24 hours apart, but we do not believe that positivity during recovery necessarily proves
infectiousness. This is a crucial question. We are reviewing the available data, examining at
how PCR positivity, cycle threshold, and viral culture line upithe goal is to develop good,

NIH Production to ICAN_001710 ”mum

clinical parameters tojustify ending precautions, rather than requiring microbiological tests. A
Get Out of Isolation Free card, if you will. The hypothesis we are testing to 2 weeks after onset
and >72 hours without symptoms. Currently the published recommendations are not
satisfying:

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/ZOleCoV/lab/guidelines—clinicaI-specimens.html
I may have more information on this topic later today.

Finally, in all complex epidemics, there is a tendency to search for a silver bullet—that one thing
that will solve all of our problems. When an intervention is in short supply,the bullet turns
platinum—”if only we could do x, the problem would be solved”. This was vaccine in 2009
H1N1, naloxone in the opioid crisis, and now testing in coronavirus. Increased access to testing
is desperately needed to control the COVID»19 pandemic. However, it is going to take a
scientifically and wholistic and systemic approach to mitigate the impact. You have nicely
outlined some of the ”next questions” that are raised when testing is more widely available.

More to follow.

Some Very complicated questions around testing have come up and will only increase.

No symptoms — get test positive — can you work

Symptoms - test negative - can you work — or do you need 2 negatives - or the test has to be done 2-3-
4 days after you develop symptoms

Test positive — back to work when — do you need negative tests — or just time - ? 2 weeks after first
symptoms, lirst test positive.

As tests become more widely available this Wlll be devil folks.

Subject: Antibody Tests and Follow»on Use of 'Survivors'

Dr. Fauci,

I apologize in advance for bugging you but please read and pass along to the appropriate person, if
useful.

In the coming weelG, an antibody test for COVID-19 should be available (I suspect). As 'survivors' are
identiﬁed in the general population and are determined to be largely ‘immune' to COVID-19, I think those
people should be given the opportunity to administer testing to others in the general population. The
employment of VOLUNTEER survivors in the administration of tests would allow immune individuals to
quickly learn how to collecc samples and deal With potential infected patients facets-face Without fear of
jeopardizmg their own health or the health of the communities in which they live. This would free up
highly trained nurses and doctors from testing and have an exponential benefit as survivors administer
tests for infection and tests for antibodies and, thus, identify additional survivors. This would suppon
more aggrssive testing to bring about the eventual end of this virus when we try to identify every lag
infected individual who needs to be quarantined.

Note: I understand we haven't yet determined whether survivors can be rte-infected. So early volunteers
may be subjected to further sickness. But the rate of re-infection should be less as a percentage than
the rate of infection among the general population. And re-infection would likely be less severe.

NoteZ: Creating a VOLUNTARY REIGSTRY of survivors (those with sufﬁcient antibodies) may have a
secondary beneﬁt to businesses. It would allow businesses to quickly hire employees who oould come in
contact with the general public (thinking of current food delivery, grocery stores, daycare...and

|ater.. teachers, anyone in the medical or dental ﬁeld, other retail businesses).

I do understand my recommendations would generate HIPAA concerns but these are extraordinary times
which call for outeofetherbox ideas...and this would all be voluntary.

Thank you for taking a couple of minutes to read this and thank you for managing a very difficult crisis.
You and others on your team have saved a lot of lives and we are eternally grateful.

Respectfully,
Frank Estes

I am a Nurse Practitioner 00(6) for the US Army. I have a recommendation as we move
through this terrible time in the US as well as the world. To preserve the healthcare workforce why not
give 25% of all health workers in the rrilitary the trial vaccine? Keep these workers away from patients
until which time that the body can build immunity. Let's not expose the entire medical workforce to the
COVID- 19. The idea is that this 25% can take care of the population (post-vaccine) without worry of
getting ill and causing further spread of the disease. If there is possibility of the vaccine, trial age cohorts
and demographics could play a crucial part in testing. Thank you for all you are doing to protect the
health of our Nation.

Dear Dr. Fauci.

On behalf of the organizing committee, I am writing to invite you to Keynote

the 8'" International mRNA Health Conference (htigzllwww.mrna-conference.oom/) to be held
at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel on Nov 9-10, 2020.

NIH Production to ICAN_001719 "momma

The International mRNA Health Conference is a yearly non-profit event collaboratively
organized by Curevac, BioNTech and Moderna. It brings together academic and industiy
thought leaders in the mRNA design and delivery space to explore the rapidly evolving science.
business and regulatory landscape of mRNA medicines. Over the last seven years, this 2-day
conference has become the premier destination for Industry and academic profesSionals to
network With colleagues, learn about the latest advances in mRNA technology, and to attend
scientific presentations given by the most esteemed experts in the field. Notably, it is the only
annual conference dedicated solely to mRNA therapeutics.

As a scientist with tremendous experience and the director of NlAlD, the organ ng
committee thought that conference attendees would very much appreciate hearing about
your thoughts about mRNA therapeutics, particularly vaccines, and any perspectives you
wish to share.

The organizing committee recognizes that your calendar is likely filled years in advance but we
all have our fingers crossed that you might be able to fit this into your busy schedule.

I look forward to hearing from you.

all best wishes,

Norbert

P.S. In the event that the COVlD-19 crisis is still curtailing travel in the fall, our backup plan
would be to have a completely virtual meeting on the same dates We plan to make that
decision in late Augustjearly September.

Subject: Request for your support in promoting new WHO recommendation for emergency response
operation to provide universal access to mandatory hand hygiene against COVID—19
Importance: High

Dear Dr. Fauci

Please find enclosed the new WHO recommendation on establishing universal access to hand hygiene
stations at thresholds of publicly accessible buildings and means of public transport It is now ofﬁcially
published at : httDS‘//who.int wnordocumentsrdetali/interimrrecommendationseoneobligalory»hand
hygieneagainstetransmissionrof~tovid719 I attach a pdf copy for easy reference.

I would like to request your support in promoting the recommendation as part of an international

emergency response operation providing universal access to mandatory hand hygiene and/or sanitation
against COVIDalB infections. Provided it is now made available and made obligatory whenever entering

NIH Production to ICAN_001743 “me?

and leaVlnga facility to which the general public has access, it could become possible to prevent most
smear infections by decontaminating all hands prior and after each possible contamination, both active
or passive, In addition, the measure should massively reduce transmission of other viruses and bacteria
currently burdening differential diagnosis of COVID-pneumonias. Based on the excellent experiences
made with the acceptabilityand adherence during Ebola outbreaks, repeated mandatory hand hygiene
or sanitation should thus become an almost unconscious routine of everyday life for any person having
to leave his or her private home in Corona-affected countries.

I have been asked by seniorWHO emergency management to promote the WHO recommendation for
rapid implementation with particular focus on current COVID-19 transmission epicenters such as the
USA. Providing a systematic access to hand hygiene stations and making their use obligatory priorto
entering and whenever leaving any public facility will also provide a safety net whenever current
restrictions on movements and commerce are to be progressively reduced Given the high resource
settings in the current COVID-epicentres, and the negligible cost of implementing this public health
emergency measure compared to prolonged mass confinement without safe exit strategy, I do presume

Subject: Association between Proton Pump Inhibitors and increased risk at Covidvlg death

Dr. Fauci,
There is a wealth of medical research papers about the association between Proton Pump
Inhibitors (PPI) and increased risk of community acquired pneumonia. Long term use of PPIS

reduce the pH of the stomach from 1 to 5. This reduction in stomach acid reduces the body's
ability to fight viruses.

In addition, the lower stomach pH reduce the ability to absorb key nutrients that require
gastric acid for breakdown and absorption (calcium, vitamin C & BIZ, iron, magnesium,
potassium, zinc). Lack of proper nutrients lead to a compromised immune system.

Seniors and individuals with chronic illnesses are at higher risk of plovpharmacology and dying
from Covid»19 due to Wis, The more medications an individual takes, the more likely they will
suffer from acid reflux and thus be prescribed a PPI.

Thank you for your commitment and compassion during the pandemic. God bless you.

Rega rds,

Teresa McPeak

Dear Dr. Faucil

Earlv Successes in Clinical Trial on COVID-19 Patients with High Dose IV Vitamin C
Thank you forthe invaluable work that you are doing in guiding the United States
through the current COVlD-19 pandemic.

I hope that you do not mind me contacting you, butl wanted to bring your
attention to a clinical trial that is currently taking place in China on COVIDA19
patients with high dose IV Vitamin C.

There are reports of some early successes with this treatment and I wondered if
this could be a possible stop gap treatment - that could possibly save many lives —
while we await the development of suitable drug treatments and a reliable
vaccine.

The trial in China is not due to conclude until September of this year, however,
previous trials of IVVitamin C have shown it to be a very safe treatment with little
or no adverse side effects. l have read that the Northwell Hospital Group in New
York, which operates 23 hospitals, have already started to give this treatment

to many of their COVID»19 patients.

This treatment also appears to meet the normally required criteria for a clinic trial.
The treatment has been shown to be:

1) Effective (Please see the link below to the promising trial results currently taking
place in China).

2) ﬂﬂhe treatment has been shown to be safe in many previous trials going
back wellover40 years).

3) Correct dosage is understood (The dosage is fully understood - please see the
attached Protocol).

4) The correct patients to give this treatment to (Virtually everyone in hospital
infected with COVlD-lQ).

5) The correct time in the illness to give the treatment (As soon as the infected
patient comes into hospital).

NIH Production to ICAN_001762 N'H‘mm

I hope that you and your team find the details of this clinical trial of some interest.
The hospital protocol for this treatment is attached and here is a Iinkto details of
the current trial in China along with some other relevant links:

Hey Dr. Fauci-

My name is Zach Davis, I'm the founder and editor-in-chief at The Trek, a
media company dedicated to long distance backpackers. Thank you for the
tremendous service and leadership you‘ve given this country during a time
of great need.

I‘m reaching out to inquire about the possibility of your doing a short
interview for our flagship podcast, Backpacker Radio, the #1 rated hiking
podcast on iTunes. We're putting together an episode related to how
COVlD-19 has impacted this year's class of backpackers, and would love to
feature your expert insight on why social distancing is important, and what
the future may hold for our community.

The interview would be about 20-25 minutes, though if you're only
available for a shorter period, we'll take what we can get!

Thanks for your time and thank you again for your terrific service to this
country.

Happy hiking,

Just wanted to let you know —we had a very productive and significant two-hour virtual meetingwith
leaders of industry, FDA, and NIH yesterday. I attach the bios of those who attended —which includes
the heads of R&D of nine major pharmaceutical companies. There is unanimous support for bringing
togetherall of the sectors to accelerate development of therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Tony
compared this to what happened in the early 19905 that led to successful antlvirals for HIV.

I attach the action items that came out ofthis meeting. Working groups for each of the four main topics
will be rapidly organized I will keepyou posted.

A great credit to NIH and NIAID...we're all very proud of you.

I know that you have long advocated preparation of viral vaccines against
future pandemic threats.
I’m sure that it has been difficult to convince pharmas, charitable agencies
and even the government to fund these efforts.
which would include vaccine production and storage for indefinite periods.
Perhaps there will be a greater willingness to
revisit a cost-benefit analysis of this effort in the near future.

i would be happv to serve on committees, study sections etc in an effort to
increase our ability to identify and fund firsterate

immunology research that might accelerate innovative, safe and effective
approaches to Improved viral vaccines going forward

Hi Tony, | just want to express my sincere gratitude for all you are doing
to get us through this crisis. Everyone I’ve talked to at RML expresses
their deep admiration and appreciation for your strong leadership, and
we feel proud to be working for you. We listen to your hoarse voice
every day. Personally, I have started two new lines of research to
develop and test possible therapeutics for COVID—19. The cooperation
and collaboration from everyone I’ve talked to, both here and around
the nation, has been unbelievable. Please take care of yourself and stay
strong and healthy for the sake of all of us!

Dear Dr. Anthony S. Fauci,

My name is Brendan Taglianelti; I am a Full-Time Advanced EMT provider for Milford
Ambulance Service in Milford, NH. I want to help relay your message of COV|D~19 information for state
of New Hampshire. by conducting a Facebook Live chat with myself to project information and messages
to the citizens of New Hampshire. This is a chance for us to chat for around 10 minutes and talk with a
first responder to the general public.

I have seen you do interviewswith the media/ daytime talk shows, a Facebook live chat with
Mark Zuckerberg, and even an Instagram live video with Stephen Curry from the Golden State Warriors,

I run the social media aspect of the department. and I would love to do a 1045 minute discussion (with
information to the public, as well as some question and answer] with you on Facebook (live) to have the
general public watch us talk about the pandemic and the next steps, and also maybe take some
questions asked of the public watchingwhen they comment. I also will be reaching out to the New
Hampshire State Governor Chris Sununu and Dr. Benjamin F. Chan (who is the state's epidemiologist). I
would love to have them chat with me, and have you join in on the discussion as we||.| have no
confirmed with them if they are availablevet, but I am putting things in motion.

I know that ifI was able to setup a time and date that would work around your busy and
important schedule. then I could with ample time promote it. I would love to not only get the town on
Milford to watch this. but have the stale of New Hampshire and other states nearby tune in. I know this
is a long shot and that you have way more important aspects of yourjob to complete, but i think this an
important time to have the public hearyou talk.

Please let me know if this could be possible and I would love to set this up, I don't expect to
take too much of yourtime if this can happen. Sometimes in life you just need to ask and see what
happens and this is a time where that risk is worth it to have a conversation with you about this
pandemic we are facing, especially as we ramp upfor starting to "peak” in the number of people
affected,

NIH Production to ICAN_001794 N'Hmm

Please let me know if this is possible and tell me lf you are interested in doing this with us for

To: <mcneil d1 times.com>

Hi Donald,

I hope you are staying well during these unprecedented times! I wanted to give you a
heads up that we will be unveiling a bobblehead of Dr. Anthony Fauci this Friday, April 3rd.
Dr, Fauci has become America’s voice of reason as one of the lead members ofthe White
House Coronavirus Task Force. The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum will be
donating $5 from every Dr. Fauci Bobblehead sold to the American Hospital Association in
support oi the 100 Million Mask Challenge. The hobbleheads will be available for Dre-order
on our website beginning on Friday.

Bobbleheads are the ultimate honor, and we think Dr. Fauci deserves it given what he has
done and continues to do forour country and the world in the battle against COVID-19.
The bobblehead will join a growmg number of items including donuts, socks and t-shirts
featuring Dr. Fauci, We received a lot of requests for a bobblehead of Dr. Fauci and are
excited to be able to use the bobblehead to raise funds for a vital organization that is
helping limit the spread ofthe Coronavirus while making people smile during these
unprecedented times.

Let me know if you would like the press release, pictures and graphics in advance of
Friday's release. Please hold off on publicizing anything related to the bobblehead until
Friday—any time on Friday is okay. Please also let me know if you would like a sample
when they arrive or if you have any questions.

Tony,

Thank you for taking some precious time to hear from some of the folks on the ground
confronting COVlD-19 around the country. I can‘t tell you how much we all value your
engagement and leadership on behalf of the nation. I’d love to get your take on whether
you think the types of things described it eh recent AEl report are realistic. l have serious
doubts.

Quick question — I mentioned the problem we had with FEMA test kits being recalled from
us because we did not want to use their call line and lab because too slow, -Just
wondering if that came up in your meeting today because i just heard the kits were
released to us without restrictions on how we use them. So either way, apparently
resolved.

Stay well and best regards,

Jeff

Antonia Noori Farzan

March 31, 2020 at 5:15 am. EDT

Early last week, Nick Semeraro wanted to find a way to honor Anthony S. Fauci. As the owner of a
small doughnut shop in Rochester, N.V., he had been closely tracking the latest news about the
coronavirus pandemic. And night after night, he‘d been impressed by how Fauci, the director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, approached the crisis in a calm, knowledgeable
manner.

50, as a tribute, Semeraro put the renowned immunologist’s face on a doughnut. Expecting to sell a
few hundred, he was shocked when the store sold out day after day, with thousands flying offthe
shelves. Donuts Delite was besieged with requests to shipthe buttercream—frosted creations all over
the country, and one Fauci fan drove three hours just to pick up a dozen. Soon, bakeries in Wisconsin
and Pennsylvania followed suit, using edible paper to decorate pastries with Fauci’s likeness.

”We had no idea it was going to blow up this big," Semeraro told MWW9 didn’t know everyone else
felt the same way we did,”

While Fauci was already a respected scientist before the outbreak, his appearances during White
House press briefings have made him a household name and an unlikely celebrity. With his

 

NIH Production to ICAN_001809 ”Mum

straightforward demeanor and willingness to contradict President Trump, he’s begun to develop the
same kind of cult following as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and former special counsel
Robert S. Mueller III, who inspired countless "Plank like RBG" tank tops and a bizarre illustrated
children's book respectively,

Even as whole swaths of the global economy collapse, the pandemic has created a robust cottage
industry of Fauci-themed merchandise, including bottle openers, magnets and mugs. On Et_sy, you can
buy “Honk for Dr. Fauci” bumper stickers, prayer candles depicting "St. Fauci" and Licks printed with
Fauci’sface. Graphic Trshirts bearslogans such as ”I Need a Hero” and "In Dr. Fauci We Trust.”

if so inclined, you can even decorate your home with an ”l Heart Dr. Fauci” throw pillow or purchase
a replica of Fauci‘s jersey from the time he captained the basketball team at Manhattan's Regis High
School. Lingua Franca, which sells cashmere sweaters embroidered With resistance-friendly slogans
for $380 and up, recently began taking orders for an army-green ”Dr. Fauci Fan Club’ knit.

In honor of Fauci’s ltalian heritage, a clam bar in Long Island named a linguine dish after him this
week. [Available for pickup only, "the linguine with white clam sauce shares origins with Fauci, as the
sauce itself was invented in the Fauci Family's native Sciacca, Italy,” the restaurant claimed in a
statement.)

As countless Americans remain glued to the news while trying to stay indoors, a robust fauci fandom
has flourished online. On FaLebouk, the "Dr. Anthony S. Fauci Fan Club" has over 32 000 members.
Thousands more congregate in groups with names such as "Dr. Anthony 5. Fauci, the Man, the Myth,
the Legend,” ”Dr. Fauci Speaks, We Listen" and "Dr. Fauci Memes for Social Distance Teens.”

An unassuming 79—yearvold public servant who has advised six presidents, Fauci has become a
“reliable constant in a time of uncertainty,” The Washington Post's Ellen McCarthy and Ben Terris
reported. But his admirers — and there are a lot of them — worry that it's only a matter of time
before he’s sidelined by Trump.

When Fauci missed a White House ncws conference earlier this month, panic erupted on TWittcr,
along with speculation that he could be sick. There was palpable reliefwhen he resumed his regular
position at the podium the following day and appeared to hide some exasperation as Trump
referenced "the deep state."

Fauci later explained that he had simply been trying to dislodge a lozenge from his throat. But the
much-analyzed “Fauci facepalm” had already become a meme, deployed by liberal members of
what‘s known as the resistance.

Fauci‘s newfound fame can be partially attributed to his willingness to engage with all forms of media
— in recent weeks, he‘s gone on a Barstool Sports podcast, chatted with basketball starSteph Curry
on Instagram Live as Barack Obama listened in, and appeared on “The Daily Show WithTrevor Noah."
But it also undoubtedly helps that his fans tend to take social distancing seriously and consequently
have ample spare time to produce fan art or perform songs written (or modified) in his honor.

0n social media, Fauci‘s virtual fan clubs peruse old photos of the infectious disease expert in search
of ”comfy turtleneck vibes ” stitch his face on embroidery hoops and discuss erecting statues as
tribute. They frost his name on cookies and joke about constructing shrines in his honor. Prominent
activists and entertainers confess to wanting to marry him, or have him tuck them into bed.

Fauci has remained characteristically modest about his new status as a cult figure, “Well, that’s very
nice,” he responded when McCarthy and Terris mentioned that people all overthe country were
praying for him. Of course, that means that hisfan base has only continued to grow,

”l never met a guy that, worldwide, he is so loved,“ Semeraro, the Rochesterdoughnut shop
owner,told CNN. ”And a month ago, we never knew his first and last name.”

Dear Dr Fauci

I was Just re-reading yourlanuary 23 Viewpoint article in JAMA. 50 little time has passed,
but so much has changed, and your comments seem prescient.

l have been working on emergent/re-emergent infectious agents for some time, and
authored a 2018 report forthe UK government on vaccine responses that was summarised
in a Vaccine publication last October attached, As almost everyone else, my attention has
been redirected to Covidv19, although monkeypox remains a focus of my interest.

You and your colleagues may be interested in two short documents! produced for the UK
government on the 20m and 22”d of March That also seems long ago now!

As fellow citizen of our planet, I thank you and colleagues for your unstinting efforts to
control infectious disease and Covid-lQ in particular.

Warmest wishes

Dr. Fauci,

In addition, I found the attachedd review on masks that addresses use in the community settings.
Attached are the paper and figure 3, which summarizes the data from 9 very diverse RCTs (overlapping
with what I had sent earlier).

Button: line: generally there were not differences in lLl/Ukl/ur ﬂu rates when masks were used,
although when early use and compliance was taken into account, a few times a difference was seen.

In addition:

This case control study noted that, among SARS patients in Hong Kong without a known source of
infection, cases (27.9%) were less likely than uniniected controls (58.7%) to report wearing a mask
frequently in public, for what that‘s worth.

For God's sake, Tony -- this is me, not simply an unknown
"messenger" from the general public! We go back together
for many, many years (to our days together at the NIH,
remember?) As you may recall, we worked (successfully)
during the infamous 1969 "March on Washington", among
other histo1ically inigortant7events.

Although I am nowf 7 7 7 7 on I continue to pay careful
attention to world events, and this IS one that exceeds any
others that have occurred In our lifetime!

As I wrote in my previous email, I have become convinced that COVID—19 is
behaving as an airborne virus and, therefore, we should be directing our
mitigation efforts toward more comprehensive aerial eradication

procedures!

Think about the most recent reports <— namely that imprisoned inmates, and
a young baby, have recently been reported as "infected" with this virus.

transmission by viable airborne virus could certainly happen!

Subject: imitation to be the keynote speaker at an Insurance Medicme Conterence in Washington, DC in
October.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I hope this email finds you well. It is abundantly obvious from the countless sifts through data and
tallies of cases, interviews and press conferences, social media appearances, etc. that your schedule is
crazy these days. As a practicing physician and an American, I am proud to be represented by you and
thankyou for your efforts on our behalf. I realize with your schedule and with the thousands of emails,
this one may not make it, but I wanted to take a shot in the dark.

I am currently the Chief Medical Officer of a reinsurer and am on the planning committee for the
American Academy of Insurance Medicine‘s annual meeting which will be held in DC this year October
18-21, Dr. Michael Osterholm had agreed to speak at the conference back in January as ourﬁrst
keynote speaker on the subject of pandemics, preparedness. I’d heard him speak before at Prudential (I
was medical director there and we were a member company of CIDRAP) and his talk mirrored his book
which I’ve also read. Regretfully, 2 weeks ago I received notice from Laurel, his EA, that he is unable to
attend the meeting because he needs to travel to London that week fora meeting he is heading. I think
that a talk on the topic is a must at any medical meeting and after hearing your pressers and coming to
rely on your sage status updates and advice, coupled With the fact that the conference is in DC, I thought
I'd give this a shot Would you be AAlM's keynote speaker this year?

In the midst of the current COViD-19 pandemic, we understand many industry conferences have had to
be canceled. We are continuing to closely monitor the trend of the COVID-lB virus, and may have to do
the same for the AAIM meeting in October, but if there is an opportunity to gatherand learn, we'd like
to prepare for it,

The audience is medical directors that work in the life, health, disability and longterm care space. Some
are clinically active. Some of them are resources for health emergency planning for their companies.
The audience comes mostly from North America, although other countries/continents are well
represented.

The purpose of the meeting is really to illustrate novel trends in the industry that Will likely impact

morbidity and mortality in the near or distant future. We’ve had talks on CRISPR, marijuana, precismn
medicine, data analytics. They’re not hard core morbidity or mortality focused, but do touch on it.

NIH Production to ICAN_001833 "'“mu‘Z‘

Given the scope of the meeting and the attendees and industries they represent, lthink that a lecture
on pandemics, bioterrorism and emerging infectious disease, especially in light of COVID-lS, is
necessary. lthink you would teach new concepts to a team of doctors that would identify with some of
the system gaps in our current supply chain and their impact on human health, wellbeing and survival.
You’d provide experience and insight on what went wrong and what could be fixed in the future to make
us collectively better prepared.

We would be honored to have you speak and I’m glad to continue discussion of logistics with someone
else on yourteam. if you needed more information about scope, I can certainly provide that. We do
provide an honorarium and will cover travel and hotel expenses.

Thanks so much in advance for any consideration you might give this request/offer and most of all thank
you for your direction, demeanorand dedication at this global time of crisis.

Best,

diseases with limited available clinical data. We are committed to the
non-proﬁt dissemination of our COVlD—19 discoveries to the public to
facilitate the search for COVID-19 effective treatments.

SARS-CcV—Z is fundamentally different from all the other viruses that the
world has hitherto known, so treatments must he rationally designed to
avoid fueling the adaptive mutation and the latent infection of SARS

Abstract

Summary Background The novel coronavirus (CoV) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV»2
outbreak started at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread over 100 countries. SARSrCoVVZ uses
the membrane protein Angiotensln | convening enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. Indeed, it was
reported that the balance of RenIn-Anglotensln System (RAS), regulated by both ACE and ACEZ, was
altered in COV!D»19 patients. It is controversial. however, whether commonly used anti-hypertensive
drugs Angiotensin | converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEl) and Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARE) shail be
continued in the confirmed COVlD-19 patients. This study was designed to investigate any difference in
disease severity between COVlD-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity. The included COVID-lS
patients used ACEI, ARE, calcium channel blockers (CCE), beta blockers (BB), orthiazide to treat
preexisting hypertension prior to the hospital were compared to patients who did not take any ofthose
drugs‘ Methods In this multicentre retrospective study. clinical data of 511 COVlD-IS patients were
analyzed. Patients were categorized into six sub-groups of hypertension comorbidity based on
treatment using one oiantI-hvpertenslon drugs (ACEI, ARB, CCB, BB. thiaZIde), or none. A meta-analysis
was performed to evaluate the use of ACEI and ARE associated with pneumonia using published studies.
Findings Among the elderly (age>65) COVID-IS patients with hypertension comorbidity, the risk of
COVID-19—S (severe disease) was significantly decreased in patients who took ARB drugs prior to
hospitalization compared to patients who took no drugs (OR=D.343, 95% CI 0118-0316, {1:13.025}. The
meta-analysis showed that ARE use has positive effects associated with morbidity and mortality of
pneumonia. Interpretation Elderly (age>65) COVIDrlB patients with hypertension comorbidity who are
taking ARB anti-hypertension drugs may be less likely to develop severe lung disease compared to
patients who take no anti-hypertension drugs. Funding National Natural Science Foundation of China,

Americans may have the war in Vietnam to thank for Anthony S. Fauci.

An adviser to six presidents and now the trusted publicface of the scientific response to the coronaVirus
pandemic, Fauci has worked at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for more than a half-century e
beginning in 1968 with a group of doctors cheekily known as Vellow Berets.

Duringthe conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, the U.S. military faced a pressing need for physicians. In 1966,
during Fauci’s senior yearat Cornell University Medical College, a military recruiter came to tell the
assembled students: ”After you finish medical school, every one of you except the two women will
either be in the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, or the Public Health Sen/ice.” The last option, entering
the Public Health Service, entailed assignment at the NlH, the Centers for Disease Control orthe Indian
Health Service.

Those who were selected to serve at the NIH were known officially as clinical associates, but Informally
they were referred to as Yellow Berets. Whether the designation was born in jest or derision, it was
intended as a foil to the Green Berets of the Army Special Forces. Fauci never liked the label because it
implied an unwillingness to serve in harm's way. “As a physician,” Fauci said, “I felt ifl had to go [to
Vietnam]. i wotild gladly do my part to try to help "

The competition for the limited number of Vellow Beret slots was so intense that only the best and
brightest young physicians were selected. Fauci, the top graduate in his medical school class, was one of
seven tlrosen front 140 applicants to train in his laboratory or interest. As described in my book “Medal
Winners: How the Vietnam War Launched Medical Careers ” the class of Yellow Berets that entered with
Fauci included four future Nobel laureates: Joseph Goldstein, Michael Brown, Harold Varmus and Robert
Lefkowitz.

Each new appointee completed two years of clinicaltraining before arriving at the NIH.Their primary
responsibility was learning how to conduct basic research under the guidance of a senior scientist. The
second job was to care for patients at the NIH Cli cal Center. Fauci and his fellow infectious disease
colleagues also helped to care forwoundcd service members at the nearby National Naval Medical
Center.

Fauci, who had some research experience In medlcai school, tralned at the NIH forthree years underthe
tutelage of Sheldon Wolf-f — a pioneer in the relationship between the immune system and infectious
diseases. Following a year of additional clinical training back in New York, Fauci returned to the NIH as a
senior scientist conducting pioneering work, first on autoimmune conditions, then transitioning to study
the newly emerging disease that would become known as AIDS.

When he entered the clinical associate program, Fauci's ambition was to become a medical school
professort Had the Vietnam War not brought him to the NIH, Fauci probably would have remained in
academia and the country never would have benefited from his extraordinary publicservice.

Instead, from his position as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Fauci
has helped shape national policies related to HIV, bloterrorlsm and a series of pandemic threats
including avian influenza, H1N1 (swine) influenza, Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome. It is
hard to imagine any other physician who has had such a sustained and profound impact on the health of
our nation.

While Fauci remained at the NIH for his entire professional career, most of his fellow Vellow Berets left
Bethesda aftertheirtraining was completed and headed forjobs at universities. Acrossthe nation, the
former Vellow Berets became medical school scientists, department chairs and cleans. More than 60
former clinical associates, including Fauci, were elected to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences,
and he also was one of the more than 125 Vellow Beret alumni elected to the Institute of Medicine (now
the National Academy of Medicine). In addition, Fauci was one of 10 alumni to receive the National
Medal of Science.

For all the scars left by the Vietnam War, we should not overlook the fact. that in its absence. 50 years
later the country would probably not have Anthony Fauci guiding us through our current crisls. Dr. Fauci,

we salute you and yourfellow Vellow Berets.

Hi Patty: A few important updates. And a request forthis weekend/Sunday.

 

Z) We have been working with John Burklow/Dr. Collins/HHS on access to the Task Force. The
Task Force came backto us and asked us for more details about ourappmach. we gave them a
written description of the overall approach of documenting For history the role of the Task
Force, it’s leadership, NIH, NIAlD, and Dr. Pauci. Burkluwis working with us on this.

3) Could I have aten minute phone conversation with Dr. Fauci this weekend, importantil
think—to update him on details personally,

4) We wnuld like, 11 possible to start filming with Dr. Fauci this weekend. Could we film Dr.
Fauci exiting his house and going in the live truck for Sunday morning interviews and then
going back home or off to the WH. We wuuld then match thatin the ﬁlm with the feed from
the truck uf him sitting down and get archlve from the shows he appears, We are close by. Zac
(DP, who Dr. Fauci knows) has been In complete self—quarantine fortwo weeks before he left
New York State and We are now here a week. He is completelygood by selﬂquarantlne rules
for abave ﬁlming.

Thanks to the three of you for the work, The communication is life-saving. l have a couple of
cluse friends on the frontline and they asked me to relay how deeply grateful they are for the
wurkynu are all doing.

Hi Patty:

Zac and l are here and situated. I know you are drinking through ten firehoses. I want
to preserve sleep and health for Dr. Fauci. But it would be fantastic to have a 15
minute video (with distancing) Q and A in the garden of his house or in the house
this weekw what he is working on just scientiﬁcally—vaccines, treatments, disease
understanding. I want to capture the focus and urgency ofthe real time scientiﬁc
work on COVID719, If we need to we can figure out how to do it with audio, but
would love to see if we could do this in 15 minutes on video. Again, anytime this

week,

Hi Tony, Hugh, and Emily
Hope you are doing well and getting a chance to pause (especially Tony!) after another breathless sprint
of a week.

The NlBlB community has unique capacity to desIgn, build, and deploy an array of powerful biomedical
technologies Much of our attention over the past year has been on early disease detection and
prevention, and the integration ofdigital/personal health with conventional medicine. The COVID-19
crisis seems to have many challenges that are ideally matched for our capabilitia. With the $60M NIBlB
will receive in the supplement, we are In a unique position to make a contribution

NIH Production to ICAN_001897 ""“mm‘m

I am hoping we can meetwith you to reﬁne ideas and coordinate as we develop mechanisms to marshal
these resources. Yourinsight will play an essential role in helping us move forward wisely, NIBIB has
never received anything remotely like this before and we are in unfamiliar territory. I think it reflects, in
part, the confidence—ind hapE. that people have in advanced technologies to change lives. We are
determined to convert these dollars into tangible methods and devices and need your help in optimizing
our strategy.

lam forwarding my slide from the science presentation on Wednesday and my follow up email to
Francls and Larry to give you a sense ol our direztion (apologles for the information blasll). We have
also been draftinga NOSI with several topic areas that I am adding helow..,note that we are in the
process of condensing and refining these to simplify and more closely resemble our pay plan. I had a
great conversation with Francis in a follow up call Thursday and he suggested—

I look forward to yourthoughts/comments and hope we (cc’d NIBIB Ieadershlp Jlll Heernskerk and David
George) can schedule a time to talk. Thank you for considering this, I know you are overflowing with
emalls and requests! If it's easier tojust give me a call, my cell 15—, I can give you the quick

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I hope all goes well. I wanted to quickly follow up and see if you might be
free for a quick interview on Monday — it would mean so much to include
your voice in the piece.

Is there a time on Monday that might work for you? We can jump on the
phone for a 5 - 10 minute call if that works better for you.

Best.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I hope this finds you well and thank you for all the work you are doing. I
run the digital magazine, Frame, which publishes interactive
documentaries made formobile phones. We are working on a story about
the current effort to create a coronavirus vaccine and would love to
interview you for the piece.

We've interviewed Regeneron‘s Chief Scientiﬁc Ofﬁceri George
Yancopoulos, and the piece will tell the story of Regeneron's push to
create a coronavirus vaccine in record time. I was hoping you could speak
to the broader issue of the often undercovered global threat of diseases
and the lack of funding going toward infectious diseases.

NIH Production to ICAN_001907 "'“4‘00‘93

Would you potentially be available for a short video interview sometime
between 10am - 7pm EST tomorrow? Alternatively, would you be free
sometime between 12pm - 2pm or 5pm - 7pm EST on Monday?

Look forward to hearing back and we‘d be honored to have your voice in
the story.

Here‘s a brief overview of Frame:

Frame is a newsmagazine that publishes interactive documentaries made
for mobile phones. Every Frame story tells a compelling. human story that
helps shine a light on a mayor social or political issue.

Frame stories include interactive features throughout, from maps to
timelines, that allow viewers to engage more deeply with the piece. Our

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I don't want you to waste too much time in this stressful situation.

As the doctor in charge of the hygiene of the Earner clinic in trans-Montana in Switzerland, as well as
being in contact with my colleagues in private practice, I see every day how important the need for
information and consultation of the population in this situation of insecurity is. At the same time, we are
under threat of a shortage of doctors ii We have to strictly apply the federal swiss guidelines (Art. 10b
and 10c, regulation 2 COVID—19) or if the wave of illness reduces the number of colleagues available for
consultations.

I know Tony isthe expert. but i thought this memo would be ofinterestand perhaps of help to him in
his battles.

The attached memo is from Dr. Paul Offit (U of Penn] and a colleague ofhis David Rubin. Tony may know
him, I would not be surprised.

But for you, Paul is one of the country’s topic vaccinologists and virologists. Paul developed a vaccine for
a deadlydisease. I know him well and he’s the real deal. Next to Tony he is my go to science source.

Paul in particular is a highly credible, well known national expert.

They wrote this memo on the 19th of March and it has many suggestion; that are incredibly smart and I
thought tony would want to see this immediately Paul and David are obviously available to talkasap.

Let me know.

DearJon: Greetings from La Jolla. Congratulations on your interview with Tony Fauci. I
have to admit that, until a couple of weeks ago, l have been quite critical of Tony's
apparent acquiescence with so much dangerous, incorrect and politically motivated
misinformation from the administration. I feared that the upside»down explanations from
the administration had the effect of destroying the concepts and tenets of epidemiology
and even rationalizing a completely wrong concept of communicable disease that holds
that it is unnecessaryto screen lorcarriers in an epidemic but only important to screen
symptomatic people. That is upside-down from what we all know about dealing with
epidemics and has even been endorsed by Trump, Pence and other members of the
COViD-19 task force. it seems to have become a new normal concept of communicable
disease management. Like so many things in the Trump era, facts and history are thrown
out the window and replaced by governmentallv espoused but obviously wrong concepts.
We assume to be preparing to completely deny established concepts of communicable
disease — screen only the prime suspects or the afflicted. In conversations with colleagues
here I wondered "where is Tony Fauci?" They suggested that he must be quietly and
heroically working hard being the scenes and at his personal peril to educate our leaders
rather than correcting them publicly. But I thought that, in desperate times, the public
must hear and see clear truth and denials of lies. My concept of heroes are people who act
at their personal peril - Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Martin Niemoller, Dietrich
Bornhoffer, Thankfully, I think mat the real Tony Fauci has emerged, obviously to his peril.
i wish him good luck and survival. Ifind myself wondering what the responses will be to
Trump‘s likely premature lifting of isolation and quarantining procedures and ifthe
concept of disobeying illegal and unethical orders will survive the times.

I was Ver‘y’interiested to readAGeorge Church‘s troublesome
responses in your intenliew with him in Science and to see his
ethical evaluation of He's CCRS editing experiment in China. I'm
not as generous to He as George seems to be and I think that
this work is clearly unethical. George inexplicably conju res up
the sad history of Jess Gelsinger and the effect of his death on
the evolution of the field of gene therapy. Happily, he’s right
about the fact that gene therapy is now proving itself in a
growing list of intractable diseases (underscored by the 2015
Japan Prize). That has happened because studies are now much
more carefully desrgned and carried out. But sadly, we are in an
environment in which some people conclude that human
medical manipulations - gene therapy, genome editing, stem
cell therapy , are ethical as long as they I“work". The rationale is.
“let’s do the study and if it works and doesn’t kill or otherwise
harm, it’s UK". It's not a post-factor evaluation that determines
if an instance of human experimentation is ethical and
permissible ~ it is the design of a study that determines if it is
ethical or not, George should be reminded of that fact and
should re—read the Helsinki declarations or similar codes of
human experimentation.

In any event, your interview was fascinating. Best regards,

Here are reconﬁgured charts which factor in the guidance from mathematicians at Rockefeller. As you can see‘ the

Subject: France situation COVI D-19

NIH Production to ICAN_001934 minimum

Hello,

I am once again in service since the global sanitary crisis COVID-19 hit France a couple of weeks ago. I
am now leading the Scientific Council for COVID-19, composed of 10 persons, sewing the French

President, Emmanuel Macron.

The Council was created on March the 10th and we were heavily involved in advisory activities in relation
to the President's decision to put the generalized quarantine into force, because we didn’t have any

better choice.

Firstly

We have a limited number of diagnosis tests, this prevents us from taking up a Korean-like strategy
within the next few days. However, by the end of the quarantine (within the following six weeks), we will
be able to have a generalisation of the diagnosis test and develop korean»lil<e apps, as well as a strategy
for testing and treatment if we have any drugs available by this time. Before this, we will go through a
difﬁcult phase in the following weeks, because we won’t have enough beds in our care units in some part

of France

Secondly

On the therapeutic level, Yazdan Yazdanpanah has taken my place and who is now leading REACl'ing.

Tomorrow morning a french-european medical trial will begin, under the control ofthe WHO, with 5 arms
(placebo/kalab'a/kaiatra +interferon be'ta / product of Guilead / hydroxychloroquine alone or in

combination for next week).

As you may know, we are currently facing a press buzz since the announcement made by Dr. Raoult
about the effectiveness of hydroxy-chloroquine. His data is not particularly convincing. We can distinguish
a slight positive signal but it must be confirmed by a well made randomised trial. We also started a
monkey-model study with HC and we should have the results by the end of next week. Also a cohort of
severe COVID+ patients have been created and some will be treated with HC : we will analyse those
results with all the consciousness needed. It will also be possible to do a prevention trial for healthcare

NIH Production to ICAN_001935

professionals and aging people with NC. I have an enormous political pressure to release HC and to give
it to everyone but I am currently resxsting...

How Is the situatlon In the USA, especially after Trump’s announcement 7 What Is the NIH pusltlon ?
What will be put into force ?

Thanks for your answer.

I put Yazdan Yazdanpanah in a copy ofthls email.

DearDoctor Fauci. My name is Rita Apgar and If by chance you noticed my last name, as my fathersaid
many years ago,‘ "I have lived in Italy for almost 50 years
and the sagacious finger of destiny pointed my way to Italy, the true home of my heart, although not a
drop of Italian blood flows through it. But the love of Italy and the Italians pumps through my heart
every second of my existence.

That sagaclous finger of destin pointed the way, and I followed it In faith to '
where I had lived As soon as I set foot for the
first time In the house In this funky ghost town of a medieval village, I felt that we belonged together.
And, practically speaking, at the time, it was the perfect solution to some weighty personal problems.
Heartand mind were in peaceful agreement.

I have a dear friend who is an infectious disease specialist at the hospital in Asti. She is, obviously.
extremely busy these days but she took the time to call me Sunday evening and we talked about you.
She said to me, " you know, when l was just a graduate student, I was a secret groupie of Dr. Fauci, and
once when he was at a meeting or a conference or something (I'm not sure where or when) l was able to
ask him a few questions." I was thrilled, of course, since I also try to watch every appearance you make
on TV. I will not add anything in this regard.

Dear Dr, Fauci,

The home care industry cares for tens of millions of our most vulnerable citizens In their homes every
day. We provide assistance with activities of daily living and instrumental activities ofdaily living, which
keeps our clients in their homes and in the lowest risk setting. Our professional Caregivers are able and
w ml to continue to provide care to clients who test positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to
the virus.

But we need your help so that home care companies do not face unreasonable liability for providing
such care. To that end, we ask for your support in getting a bill through congress like the Public
Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act), 42 USC 247d-6d, that will insulate providers like
us from claims related to the care we will be providing in these extraordinary times.

We also ask that you support creating a fund that will provide appropriate personal protective
equipment to our caregivers. Our clients should not have to bear the additional burden of the added
cost of PPE.

Additionally, we would like you to encourage the CDC to clarify its guidance on caring for COVID-19
patients (found here, here and herel that the guidance is applicable to "professional, licensed and
insured, home based care agencies.”

This clarification will givethe industry a workable standard to protect caregivers caring for COVlD-19
clients. In essence, it would establish that facernasks and gloves are sufficient PPE to care for COVID-lS
clients in the home, and not require its caregivers to comply with the healthcare setting requirements of
wearing N95 respirators, eye protection (goggles or lace shields) or gowns. This is important as a
practical matter because respirators and gowns are not readily available at this time. Moreover, most
home care workers are not trained in the proper use of respirators.

Finally, we need your help in pressuring congress to provide day care for the children of our caregivers.

If they cannot find adequate care for their children. then our clients will suffer. This is a vital step to
keep our clients in their homes.

NIH Production to ICAN_001948 N'H‘mm‘ﬁ

With you help, home care companies will be able to'

1. Relieve the burden on the healthcare system by keeping our clients out of the hospital; and

Z, Adhere to shelter—in-place measures which will flatten the curve of COVID—19's spread.

In order to save Dr. Fauci, we must destroy

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, is a study of calm and competence in
the middle of a pandemic. Which makes him an endangered
species, working as he does for a boss who is notoriously
insecure and made his name shouting "You're fired!" on a
reality TV show.

Dr. Anthony Fauci‘s
calm, reassuring competence in response to the coronavirus pandemic is placing him at serious risk of
hearing the words that made his boss famous: You're firedJabin Botsford/The Washington Post

Dr. Anthony Faucr is a burn,

A quack, a snake oil salesman.

He got his degrees online, not from Holy Cross and Cornell.

He watches Wheel of Fortune but not Jeopardy.

He’s a Vankees fan.

Such character assassination is unsavory but necessary because Fauci’s calm. reassuring competence in
response to the coronavirus pandemic is placing him at serious risk of hearing the words that made his
boss famous: Vou’re fired.

President Trump is watching and listening to the same thing we are, Le“ Fauci going to the podium to
rebut with facts the latest outbreak of paranoid anxiety or the president’sregularly reckless
statements.

 

Fauci is an oasis of rigor and reason in a barren desert of confusion and fear.

which, given who he works for, makeshim an endangered species.

During the Vietnam War, some US Army officer supposedly suggested that in order to save a village
from the Vietcong they had to destroy it.

And so, to save Dr. Fauci, we must destroy him — at least in Trump’s eyes.

Now that might sound crazy, but we’ re dealing with a crazy president in crazy circumstances

It’s not as if there’s no relevant precedent heret

Two words: Bill Bratton,

Two other words: Rudy Giuliani. Who happens to be Trump’s BFFt

Before Giuliani grew old, deranged, and more qualified to be a spokesman for Miracle Ear than the
president’s lawyer. he was the reformminded mayor of New York City.

Rudy rode into Dodge, which is what Times Square resembled at the time, and vowed to clean it up. His
hand-picked sheriff was Dorchester’s own Bill Brattonc

As police commissioner, Bratton did much to stem violent crime in the nation's biggest city, but even
more remarkably got his cops to reduce the incidence of more minor, so-called quality of life crimes that

NIH Production to ICAN_001959 ””0003“

had made New York less livable. from the tony sections at Manhattan to the Tony Fauci sections of
Brooklyn.

Bratton did hisjob too well. He ended up on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as the guy who pulled
the worm out of the Big Apple. He became more popular than the mayor.

Thisdrove Giuliani nuts. Rudy had to be the smartest guy in the room, had to get all the credit. Sound
familiar?

So Bratton had to go.

That wasn’t Bratton’s ﬁrst rodeo, Long before he landed in New York, he became the face of
progressive, modern policing in his hometown, the youngest—ever Boston Police superintendent. Police
Commissionerloe Jordan resented his overly-ambitious No.2 so he busted Bratton.

The point is, insecure bosses don't like being shown up by smarter, more competent subordinates. Small
men make big mistakes.

It may be too late to save Fauci. He just got the star treatment from Maureen Dowd in The New
Vork Times.

There used to be a thing called the Sports Illustrated curse, that after an athlete appeared on its cover
his or her career tanked.

Similarly, being in the Trump administration and getting praised by The New York Times is the kiss of
death.

Now, normally, you could print something in the Times and chances were the president wouldn't read it,
He routinely dismisses the Gray Old Lady as fake news, except when his and his family's lousy books are
mass-bought onto the newspaper's bestsellers list. He is not fond of polysvllabic words and prefers
to get his news from ”Fox & Friends" or whateverwhite nationalist website his aide Stephen Miller
might recommend,

 

But Trump reads Mo Dowd because they have known each other forever and she writes about him at a
nuanced, personal level that drives him especially cuckoo.

We’re way past the theoretical here,

Tony Fauci is in real danger, and by extension so are the rest ofus who expect — nay. pray for — one
person in the White House to be trustworthy and competent in a time of unprecedented crisis.

50, again, repeat after me, Dr. Anthony Fauci is a burn.

Long live the bum.

Hi Patty,

Thanks very much for your help yesterday and hope you’re doing well. We’re working on a
story today about Trump‘s relationship with the scientific and medical experts in the
coronavirus response, including Dr. Fauci. We’re reporting this out today but wanted to
send you what we’ve been hearing as we get it so there’s ample time to fact check
everything today. Here are some points we'd love to discuss with the best person in your
olfice or, betteryet, Dr‘ Fauci himself,

NIH Production to ICAN_001964 ”Mm

0 Panel was apoplectic about Trump's tweet yesterday saying the cure couldn‘t be
worse than the virus and indicating that he wants to reopen businesses soont

- Fauci has been forceful privatelythat unproven drugs should not be advertised to
Americans as a panacea (and he ofcourse has publicly spoken about these drugs).

- We are also reporting in a separate story that Larry Ellison is building a website for
the federal government that will collect data on the efﬁcacy of remdesivir,
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Our understanding is Fauci is vehemently
opposed to this idea and has pushed back on it, citing patient privacy concerns
with the website and collecting data in this way outside of an approved FDA trial,

Again, we‘d love to speak with Dr. Fauci and any others in your office who may have insight
into these particular issues and other aspects of the coronavirus resoonse. Please feel free
to give me a call on my cell atany time at ‘ ' ' ' (331(5)

a time of great public need

F auci is the world's leading authority on
infectious diseases and the best person in the
country to help us deal with the COVlD-19
crisis.

David M. Rubenstein

Opinion contributor

Some viewers ofthe daily White House coronavirus brieﬁngs may
wonder why everyone increasingly defers to a diminutive, Brooklyn-
acoented 79-year—old doctor, Tony Fauci.

They do because, as I have learned over many years of talking with and
more recently interviewing this man, he is without doubt the world’s
leading authority on infectious diseases, In any area ofhuman activity
or knowledge, there always seems to be one person who is the global
gold standard. In the world of infectious diseases that person is Tony
Fauci

So the American people i indeed. people around the globe i should
be grateful that Tony has dug into this crisis with the same work—
around-the»clock, just-the—facts ma’am style that he has used

while serving under and working with six U.S. presidents. He is as
apolitical as anyone can be. I have no idea if he is registered with any
political party; I suspect though that he is rabidly Independent. His only
focus is getting the facts out, providing the best health care treatment
and information possible, and saving lives.

A top expert from AIDS to Ebola

Tony Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health in 1968, after
completing his medical training at Weill Cornell Medical Center. and
he has led the National Institute ofAllergy and Infectious Disease M
m, 36 years. Hard to believe anyone can run anything that long
and still be at the top ofhis game But Tony is. During this period, he
has dealt with every serious infectious disease challenge 7 malaria,

NIH Production to ICAN_001972

Among Tony’s best known accomplishments, beyond simply running
the institute and training dozens of the world’s top infectious disease
professionals, has been helping to discover how HIV leads to AIDS
and. later. leading the effort to create (at President George W. Bush’s
direction) the President‘s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
which has transformed the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Africa, and other
parts of the developing world. Millions oflives have been saved by this
program alone, More recently, he has been an architect and powerful
advocate of President Donald 'l'mmp’s plan for ending the AIDS
epidemic in the US. through HIV antiretroviral therapy targeted to
disease hotspots.

In his spare time, Tony has been involved with writing or editing more
than 1,100 scholarly articles and several textbooks. and, in the process,
has become one of the most cited authorities of the entire medical
profession.

For these breakthrough activities and his dedicated service (at a
govemment salary) for more than a half century (he worked at NIH for
16 years before assuming his current role), Tony has received, and
earned, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Lasker Award (called
the American Nobel by many).

With this long service and universal acclaim, one might think Tony
would let it get to his head, at least a little bit. Not the case, though.

Selfless commitment to public service

He is readily accessible to those who need treatment — he still runs a
lab at NIH i or need information. Tony still lives in the same house he
bought when he first moved to Washington, and it is there that he and
his wife Christine have raised their three talented daughters (though
none of them chose to attend medical school),

Until the latest crisis, Tony has often commuted to NIH

by Metro, typically after running three miles for his daily exercise. And
when he has been invited to make speeches in the Washington area or
on Capitol Hill, he invariably turns down a car and driver for

the Metro, (This practice has had to change of late for the obvious
reasons).

There are, of course, many other dedicated federal servants who also
view their commitment to the country and its people over ﬁnancial
rewards. But surely no federal civil servant, in any area, can exceed
Tony Fauci’s long-term and selﬂess commitment to this country and
the health of its people.

NIH Production to ICAN_001973

<imag6002,jpg>

I tried years ago, when Tony was approaching a normal retirement age,
to see if he might want after a normal lifetime of federal service. to take
some ofhis considerable skills and knowledge to the private sector. He
quickly said no 7 money did not motivate him, serving the country
did. And he stayed at NIH — to the country’s good fortune.

If there is any one medical professional who can help the country deal
with the COVID-19 crisis, it is Tony Fauci, an example of the best this
country has to offer.

He is not a miracle worker. No one is.

But Tony Fauci has the decades of experience needed to understand
infectious disease prohiems and prescribe a treatment that should, in
time, provide the requisite comfort. even if, in the short term, the
medicine is painful and inconvenient.

Colleagues.

I’m glad to hear that most of you are able to join a three-hour virtual meeting on
Wednesday March 25 to discuss scientific opportunitles In the effort to conquer the
COVlD-19 pandemic While NIAID rightly has the lead in this effort for NIH, and is deeply
invested ln projects in both their intramural and extramural programs. it’s clear thata
number of other [(25 have creative ideas and a strong motivation to try to help with this
global crisis. So this certainly seems like a time where we should gather (virtually of course)

NIH—000277

to brainstorm together, led by NIAID. and seek to identify any additional areas of
contribution that could be subject to acceleration and/or collaboration.

Hilary Marston recently convened a Deputies meeting on this subject. and le were then
asked to submit examples last Friday of projects they are pursuing in the COVIDJQ
space. Those were forwarded from Bob Eisinger to me. I have used those submissions,
including a detailed list of NIAID projects, to put together a tentative agenda for
Wednesday’s meeting. That is attached.

 

There are admittedly a lot of themes and topics here, so this will require some real
discipline in the one-slide presentations. i will try to serve as timekeeperi or maybe I‘ll
ask Larry to do that. i ii i

All IC Directors are invited to have one or two subject matter experts join them for this
virtual discussion.

Ashley Parker— will be helping me with the logistics and will have
further instructlons about how the log in will work.

Here's the specific follow up request that needs your immediate attention:
1. If your IC is pursuing a highly relevant project that’s not listed here, and that you
want the group to hear about, please send me that information ASAP,
2. if your IC is on the draft agenda to make a presentation, please submit your one
slide (except for NIAID, who gets more) to me and Ashley hy COB Tuesday
3/24. That way we can put the whole set together as a single not ﬁle.

Many thanks! This should provide a welcome respite from the many other tasks we areal]
facing right now.

Subject: Invitation tojcin the HHS Panel on Guidelines forThe Management of COVID 19

Dear Colleague,

At the request of the Office ofthe Secretary, HHS and in conjunction with the White House Task
Force we are creating a COVID-19 management guidelines panel to provide frequently updated
information to the public regardingthe treatment of patients with CDVlD-19.

This guidance will be an HHS document, will be updated frequently and will be modeled to
some degree after the ART guidelines. The Panel will include academicians and clinicians
currently caring for persons with COVID-19 and representatives from multiple US government
agencies (CDC, BARDA, FDA, VA, DOD) and professional societies. Cliff Lane, MD. Henry Masur,
MD. and Trip Guiick, MD. will co-chair, and Alice Pau, PharmD. will be the exec, sec. forthis
new panel. Those of you who are appointed to represent your federal agencies will be ex—
ofﬂcio. Other federal employees will be voting members.

I would like to invite you to be a member of this new Panel based on your expertise, We
anticipate that work will begin this week and we hope to be able to put out the first guidance in
1—2 weeks. We appreciate your willingness to join this very important effort and your work in
caring for patients during this pandemic.

The first meeting (by teleconference) will be Tuesday, March 24 at 11:00AM EDT. More details
will be provided soon.

Thank-you for considering this and for all you are doing during this most challenging time.

Hi Tony,

I’m forwarding an email [just sent to Paul Cieslak, MD ..... one of the lead docs at
the Oregon Health Authority I
gives my clinic’s Internal Medicine docs an 'lD Update’ for my CME Grand Rounds

David....he was with Lynn’s & Mort Lipsett's group at The Clinical Center.

 

r..|’d bet a coke you know all about pooled sampling .l...but wanted to pass it
along.

You have no idea how many people tell me that your COVlD-19 messages on TV,

etc, are top flight, enormously helpful and encouraging for them with the best
information, in a sea now of poor information.

Good morning, Paul.
Hope you guys at DHA are holding up OK.
I'm fine, family is fine...; ' m is dong lots oftelemedicine and seeing actual PEDS

patients at Westside Hosp. now a few days a week.
My clinic is still open but pretty quiet... we need to stay open at some level no matter what.

 

One of my colleagues from the NIH (Dr. David Brandon ...he actually published with Tony Fauci
back in the late '7Dsl believe !l..sent me this email on Saturday morning

I suspect you all know about pooled sampling, ..... David did it at the NIH for a study that I have
long forgotten about. ,..thought I'd pass it along to you ......

" | jUSt looked up to see if pooled sampling has been used to detect viruses in the past, and
found that it has been used in a number of cases including during the HIV scare. lam including
a link thttps:/jwww.israelZlcorg/israeIis-introduce-method—for-accelerated-covid-le-

testing to an article in the lay press reporting on an RT-PCR based test that uses swabs from
30-60 individuals to determine ifthe pooled sample has Covid~19. The study was successful
and they are developing it to test workers in the front line work places such as hospitals. There
is a body of literatUre using this method for other mass screenings,”

 

Then I heard that CEPHEID will be getting their Genexpert instrument validated to measure
COVID-19. Turns out we have one in my lab, use it for Chlamydia 81 Gonorrhea (we have lots
of patients here needing this testing). But as you so well know, having the instrumentation
without the collection swabs/M4 media, etc. Is a bit like biking up a blind alley. I would hope
we’ll hear more about this.

Hi Tony-

I know you are very busy but I wanted to see if you know of any effort on the part of the federal
government to issue guidance on the rationing of ventilators when the time comes? Many of my
colleagues in critical care across the country have been asking for some such guidance on a federal level.
Both for the guidance itself and to protect themselves from legal liability. Are you aware of any such
efforts? Thanks for any insights on this And thanks for all you are doing on the coronavirus effort!

Best regards.

Faviplravir, also known as T-705, Avigan. or favilavir is an antiviral drug being developed by
Toyama Chemical (Fujiﬁlm group) ofJapan with activity against many RNA viruses Like
certain other experimental antiviral drugs (T-l 105 and T-l106), it is a pyrazinecarboxamide
derivative, In experiments conducted in animals Favipiravir has shown activity against inﬂuenza
viruses, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, foot—and-mouth disease virus as well as other

ﬂaviViruses, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses and alphavirusesi” Activity against enteroviruseslz] and

Rift Valley fever virus has also been demonstratedm Favipiravir has showed limited efﬁcacy
against Zika \virus in animal studies, but was less effective than other antivirals such as MK-

608i[4] The agent has also shown some efﬁcacy against rabies,[5] and has been used
experimentally in some humans infected with the viruslbl

In February 2020, Favipiravir was being studied in China for experimental treatment ofthe
emergent COVID—l9 (novel coronavirus disease),[7][8] On March 17, Chinese ofﬁcials suggested
the drug had been effective in treating COVID in Wuhan and Shenzhenlgﬂm]

As of23 March 2020, it seems that Japan and China have issued an export ban on the substance,
Japan and China are the only countries in which favirapir is produced and approved as a medical

via international diplomatic means by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information

Mechanism of action[edit]

The mechanism of its actions is thought to be related to the selective inhibition of viral RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase.[1 1] Other research suggests that favipiravir induces lethal RNA
transversion mutations. producing a nonviable viral phenotypellzl Favipiravir is a prodrug that
is metabolized to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuianosyl-5‘»triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP),
available in both oral and intravenous fonnulations.“3][l4] Human hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) is believed to play a key role in this activation processlm
Favipiravir does not inhibit RNA or DNA synthesis in mammalian cells and is not toxic to
themm In 2014, favtpiravir was approved in Japan for stockpiling against inﬂuenza
pandemicsllél However, favipiravir has nor been shown to be effective in primary human

airway cells, casting doubt on its efﬁcacy in inﬂuenza treatmentlm

Approval statusledit]

In 2014. Japan approved Favipiravir for treating viral strains unresponsive to current

antivirals.“ 8] Toyama Chemical initially hoped that Avigan would become a new inﬂuenza drug
that could replace Tamiﬂu. However, animal experiments show the potential for teratogenic
effects on fetuses, and the approval of production by The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare

was greatly delayed and the production condition is limited only in an emergency in Japan [[9]

In March 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration completed a Phase 111 clinical trial
studying the safety and efficacy of Favipiravir in the treatment of inﬂuenza.[20]

NIH Production to ICAN_001996

On March 15. 2020 the drug was approved in China with the name Favilavir for the treatment of
influenzam] The drug was also approved for use in clinical trials for treating coronavirus
disease 201‘) pneumonia.[2 I]

On 22 March: 2020 Italy has approved the drug for experimental use against COVID-19 and has

begun conducting trials in 3 regions most affected by the diseasem] The Italian Pharmaceutical
Agency, however, has reminded the public that the existing evidence in support ofthis dnig is

scant and preliminaryl‘lj

Ebola virus trials[edit]

Some research has been done suggesting that in mouse models Favipiravir may have efﬁcacy
against Ebola. Its efﬁcacy against Ebola in humans is unproven.[24][15][26] During the 2014 West
Africa Ebola virus outbreak, it was reported that a French nurse who contracted Ebola while

volunteering for MSF in Liberia recovered after receiving a course of favipiraviri271 A clinical
trial investigating the use of favipiravir against Ebola virus disease was started in Gue’cke’dou,

Guinea, during December 2014123] Preliminary results showed a decrease in mortality rate in
patients with low-to-moderate levels of Ebola virus in the blood, but no effect on patients with
high levels ofthe virus, a group at a higher risk of deathizg] The trial design has been criticised

by Scott Hammer and others for using only historical controls.[30] The results ofthis clinical trial
were presented in February 2016 at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic

Infections (CROI) by Daouda Sissokomi and published on March 1. 2016 in PLOS
Medicineim]

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[edit]

On 17 March 2020‘ Chinese officials suggested that Favipiravir seemed to be effective in
treating COVID-19 in Wuhan and Shenzhen,[33][34][35]

A study on 80 patients comparing it to lopinavir/ritonavtr found that it significantly reduced viral
clearance time to 4 days, compared to 11 for the control group, and that 91.43% of patients had

improved CT scans with few side effectspémﬂ

As ul'23 March 2020, it seems that Japan and China have issued an export ban on the substance
Japan and China are the only countries in which favirapir is produced and approved as a medical

Japanese flu drug 'clearly effective' in treating coronavirusI says China

John Minclrillnﬂl‘

 

Medical authorities in China have said a drug used in Japan to treat new strains of inﬂuenza
appeared to be effective in coronavirus patients. Japanese media said on Wednesday.

Zhang Xinmin, an ofﬁcial at China's science and technology ministry, said favipiravir.
developed by a subsidiary ofFujiﬁlm, had produced encouraging outcomes in clinical trials in
Wuhan and Shenzhen involving 340 patients.

“It has a high degree ofsafety and is clearly effective in treatment,” Zhang told reporters on
Tuesday.

Patients who were given the medicine in Shenzhen turned negative for the virus after a median of
four days after becoming positive. compared with a median of ii days for those who were not
treated with the drug. public broadcaster NHK said.

In addition. X—rays conﬁrmed improvements in lung condition in about 9l% of the patients who
were treated with favipiravir, compared to 62% or those wrthout the drug.

Fujiﬁlm Toyama Chemical, which developed the drug 7 also known as Avigan 7 in 20l4, has
declined to comment on the claims.

Shares in the firm surged on Wednesday following Zhang’s comments. closing the morning up
14.7% at 5,207 yen, having brieﬂy hit their daily limit high of 5,238 yen.

NIH Production to ICAN_002005

Doctors in Japan are using the same drug in clinical studies on coronavirus patients with mild to
moderate symptoms, hoping it will prevent the virus from multiplying in patients.

But a Japanese health ministry source suggested the drug was not as effective in people with
more severe symptoms “We’ve given Avigan to 70 to 80 people. but it doesn’t seem to work
that well when the Virus has already multiplied," the source told the Mainichi Shimbun

The same limitations had been identiﬁed in studies involving coronavirus patients using a
combination of the IIIV antiretrovirals lopinavir and ritonavir, the source added.

In 2016, the Japanese government supplied favipiravir as an emergency aid to counter the Ebola
virus outbreak in Guinea.

Favipiravir would need govemment approval for full-scale use on Covid—l‘) patients, since it was
originally intended to treat flu.

A health ofﬁcial told the Mainiehi the drug could be approved as early as May. “But if the results
of clinical research are delayed. approval could also be delayed."

DALIAN, China —— An inﬂuenza medicine developed by a Fujiﬁlm Holdings group member is
effective against the novel coronavirus, the Chinese government said Tuesday.

The govemment plans to ofﬁcially recommend the drug's use for treatment. Fujiﬁlm Toyorna
Chemical developed favipiravir, sold under the brand Avigan.

"It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment." said Zhang Xinmin. director
ofthe science ministry's China National Center for Biotechnology Development, in a news
conference. Fujiﬁlm Toyoma Chemical developed the drug in 2014, and it has been provided to
patients in Japan as treatment for the novel comonavirus since February.

Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical signed a patent-licensing agreement for favipiravir with Fujiﬁlm
in 2016. The drugmaker received clearance to produce the drug from Chinese authorities in
February and can ramp up output of a generic version.

The clinical trial was conducted at hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, with 200 patients
participating. Test results for those receiving the drug turned negative in a shorter period. and
their pneumonia symptoms improved at a higher rate.

Pharmas on one page with action plan to solve COVID-19 together

BIOCENTURY IS PROVIDING THIS STORY FOR FREE GIVEN THE URGENT NEED FOR
INFORMATION ABOUT THE COVID-19 CRISIS,

BY C. SIMONE FISHBURN, EDITOR IN CHIEF I MAR 25, 2020 l 9:17 PM EDT
Agrand—scale behind-the—scenes effort by the pharmaceutical companies is under
way to expedite the creation of therapies and vaccines to treat COVIDJS.

According to the participants who spoke with BioCentury under conditions of
anonymity, R&D heads from at least 10 companies have been gathering several
times a week, setting in motion an action plan to use their top talent in different
disciplines to produce an industryrwide response, the likes of which haven’t been
seen since the private sector’s coordinated contribution during World War II.

Regulatory heads and manufacturing heads have been holding meetings as well,
coordinating to minimize duplication of effort, streamline work and advance
efficient testing of compounds and vaccines,

The R&D group is creating working principles to accelerate new COVID»19 therapies
and vaccines agnostic to their market potential, eliminating bureaucratic and
technical or scientific barriers, and focusing on filling gaps not adequately filled by
other initiatives and which the consortium is uniquely suited to address.

NIH Production to ICAN_002018 "mum

The pharma group’s leaders also intend to offer resources to biotechs and
academic groups pursuing countermeasures who may not want to join the effort
but could benefit from expert guidance.

Flying the plane as they build it, the collaborators intend to create a clearing house
of ideas for testing of molecules and vaccines, with workinggroups to vet the ideas
and expedite testing on the most promising via clinical or preclinical testing.

According to the participants who spoke to BioCentury, the structure will probably
evolve overtime, Currently, the model involves five working groups, for clinical
phase repurposing, novel small molecule antivirals, novel antibodies, preventive
vaccines and preclinical reourbosing. Each will be headed by a Dharma R&D
executive and will be responsible for prioritizing potential compounds and
specifying actions.

Two platform groups will integrate across modalities: a clinical trial acceleration
group and a data sharing group.

“This is not a time to think about proprietary information or IP or margins. We

Hi Paul,

I have done some work on the idea of an “AMP like" COVID project. As I
mentioned, Mikael Dolsten has been quite enthusiastic. For FDA, Peter Marks,
Janet Woodcock, and Steve Hahn were all extremely positive about this
opportunity for a shared consideration about priorities. Tony Fauci and his team
are totally in favor, and the FNIH (David Wholley and Maria Freire) stands ready to
serve as convener. I thought the first step would be a 90 to 120-minute virtual
meeting — hopefully next week. Attached is a draft precis of what this might look
like; I have left out the roster because that is very much a work in progress.

Meanwhile I saw reports thatthere are related partnership discussions going on

Do you have a few minutes to speak with me about this? I'm at 00(6), and

Hey again Paul,

Really hoping to hear your thoughts on this proposal. FDA is highly

Subject: Reaching out about partnerships and COVlD-19

Dear Paul,

I’ve been thinking that this is a time where we ought to have the best and
brightest minds from industry, NIH, academia, and FDA around the same
table to identify ways that we can move the coronavirus agenda forward to
life-saving products as quickly as possible. Several pharmas and biotechs have
been reaching out to NIH to identify viral assays and animal models that can

NIH Production to ICAN_002020 "mums

be run in a ESL-3 facility. Other similarcontacts I've had with pharma and
biotech tell me thatthere is a high degree of interest and willingness to
combine forces at this time of crisis.

This isn’t exactly a precise recipe for AM P-COVID. but it has some of the same
flavors Would it be useful for FNIH to convene a virtual meeting with a few
heads of R&D (hopefully you; Mikael Dolsten has already expressed
enthusiasm; and l'd be interested in your suggestions of others), FDA (Marks
and Woodcock), leaders from NIAID and a few other NlH Institutes with
equity in this space. We might be able to make a short list of catalytic actions
that neithersector can do optimally right now, but togetherwe can do
rapidly.

The focus would be on therapeutics and vaccines. But l can imagine a
separate session on diagnostics

Does this sound worthwhile to you?
Thanks, I always value your advice and partnership.

Subject: Medical staff need COVlD-19 NIH survival data on N85 respirators to help alleviate shortage

Dear Dr. Fauci,
The biggest concern of my hospital (olleagues is the shortage of protective masks. If any research is
being done that might drive safe reuse of N-9S respirators, no one I know has seen it. These should be

simple studies to do.

If the virus is shown to die within a few days and moisture dries up, then the number of masks
needing disposal could drop drastically.

In that situation, each prowder at risk could be given five N-95 masks, one for each day of the week.
The provider would wearthe N-95 mask for one working day, say Monday. and then place it into a paper
bag in a secure location. The provider would not use that mask again until the following Monday; ie
seven days later.

The only question, then, would be: how many times can this be repeated? Will the mask lose any
protective qualities over time?

Please assign someone to do these studies soon.
I'm also very pleased that our national leaders now seem to be listeningto you more closely.
Tha nk you for your efforts.

Thank you for your note. Shown below are my answers to your questions. I
hope that you find them helpful.

1. How do you recommend I reassure our staff on dealing with the stressors of COVID-IS?
This Is indeed an unprecedented and stressiul tirne, Stress can often come from the unknown.
In times of stress it is critical totake care of one’s physical health, by eating well, getting enough
sleep, and exercising. in addition, maintaining connections With family and friends [via phone
calls, email, or video chatting) while physically sOCially distancing is very important.

2. Can COVID-lS be contracted from a corpse?
Infection control measures should be undertaken when dealing with deceased individuals with
known or Suspected COVlDrlg The CDC provides guidance on this issue hereCeutiutr

3. If someone has been a user of Hydroxychloroqvine for years, are they susceptible to contracting
COVID-19?
Clinical trials are underway to determine if hydroxycnloroouine is effective in preventing COVID-
19 in exposed oeisons Until we know the answer to this question persons whotake
liydroxychlomdu-ne on a dailybaSis for anotner medical condition should consider themselves
vulnerable to COVIDJQ and take appropriate and recommended measures to protect
themselves

4. Are masks and gloves truly effective, if so, why are so many medical protessionals contracting
the virus?
I believe that infection control strategies which include proper use of personal protective
equipment lPPE) as recommended by the CDC are effective.

Tony,

Thank you tor all that you are doing in the fight against CUVlD-19. Your steady leadership and grounding
in the science, and your ability to communicate complex information clearly to policymakers and the
public, are what the world needs during this crisis. 1 know we will see the other side of this pandemic,
and you will have once again saved many lives with your onx.

I am one step removed from this response, as lam on a detail assignment from FEMAto the Naval
Academy, but have been sharing information with the Superintendent and his senior leadership team so
that they can make good decisions to protect the community while meeting the Academy’s mission. I
have thought back to the H1N1 response in 2009—2010 many times since this began.

Again, thank you for what you’re doing. My best wishes to you and your family.

Subject: ASF: daily data call from Sec of:

Per request from the Secretary‘s ofﬁce that I sent you this morning. below is what I propose to submit
tomorrow morning for the new daily 9am data call. i will plan to submit pretty much the same thing every
day. I will not clog your in-box with it unless there is a signiﬁcant update.

RFI from Staff Sec:

1. For tomorrow’s press conference, what information or topics do you
recommend be included in the President’s remarks? Please provide talking
point-level details and support.

Nothing specific from NIAID at this time.

2. For tomorrow’s press conference, on what information (if any) do you
intend to speak?

Specific topics will depend on questions from reporters. Dr. Fauci has been asked about the effect of
social distancing: considerations that would factor into returning the country to normal life; off-label
use of treatments such as nydrochloroqurne; the status of clinical trials; and the disproportionate
impact of COVID—tB on communities of color.

NlAlD—speciﬂc talking points;

0 NIAID has mobilized a rapid research response to quickly develop effective
countermeasures for COVID-19. including diagnostics, vaccines to prevent
disease and treatments.

NIH Production to ICAN_002058

o NIAID is supporting a clinical trial 01 the antrvtral temdeswtr and is
investigating other treatments, including antibody therapies and other antivirals,
for their activity against SARS—CoV-Z. Well-designed clinical trials are the best
way to evaluate potential treatments for safety and efﬁcacy.

o NIAID is supporting an early-stage clinical trial of an mveshqational vaccme
called rnRNA-1273, developed by NIAID scientists and the biotechnology
company Moderna. The study launched ﬁrst in Seattle, with a second site
recently added in Atlanta. NIAID is researching additional vaccine candidates.

a NIAID has launched a serosurvey stuoythat aims to determine how many
adults in the United States without a conﬁrmed history of COVlD-19 have
antibodies to the virus. Researchers will collect and analyze blood samples from
as many as 10,000 adult volunteers without a conﬁrmed history of COVID-19.
The results will help illuminate the extent to which the novel coronavirus has
spread undetected in the United States and provide insights into which
communities and populations are most affected. NOTE: This serosurvey is for
research purposes. It is not meant to be a way for people to access antibody
testing for personal knowledge of prior infection history, If it is portrayed as a way
for people to “get tested" to understand their own infection history, we can expect
that people will inaccurately blame the government for not receiving results in a
timely manner, People can request to learn about their results. which will be
available only after weeks or months of analysis]

. NIAID is expanding its portfolio of basic research on coronaviruses and
emerging pathogens to characterize SARS-CoV-Z (the virus that causes COVID-
19) and understand how it causes disease. NIAID also is using animal models to
better understand the infection and to investigate optimal ways to treat and
prevent COVID-tQ.

3. Are there topics or announcements for future press conferences (other
than tomorrow's) that you would like to flag for the President’s speechwriting

FYI—per request below, HHS is setting up a daily data call. We need to tell them at Sam what
you are going to discuss at the daily press conference at the end of the day. My observation is
that this may be hard to predict. However, we can certainly come up with some boilerplate
talking points that we re-submit every day, emphasizing the importance of properly designed
clinical trials as the best way to identify treatments.

Hi, Dr. Fauci.

Thank you so much for keeping things honest and know that I am such a champion of you.

I hope that reaching out is okay. lwork at HHS/I05 team. As I sit here at home and have been
thinking about the shortage of medical supplies, doggie cones actually can be used as

C/O AnthonyS. Fauci, MD.

Hello Dr. Fauci,

NIH Production to ICAN_002079

In the current state of medical knowledge and research in the pharmaceutical industry, there is
no short- or medium-term solution to prevent disease or cure patients with SARS-Cov»2 (CDVID-
19).

With this letter, I would like to make you aware of the preventive and curative potential of
essential oils (E05); lives could be saved.

Scientific aromatherapy: use of aromatic compounds extracted from plants — essential oils - for
medical purposes; 'hard' science of nature. based among other things. on in—depth knowledge of
organic chemistry. We are not talking about periumery or occult sciences.

According to Mr. Dominique BAUDDUX, an internationally known Belgian pharmacist and
"aromatologist": there is a multitude of research on the antiviral properties of essential oils.
The results are impressive and indisputable. Here are some viruses for which we have real
data:

- Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-Cov (it is a coronavirus]
I The H1N1llu virus

I Avian influenza virus type H5N1 and subtypes H7N3 and HSNZ

I The antiinfectious bronchitis virus (IBV)

I Herpes simplex virus HSV

I Dengue virus DEN

I Newcastle disease vims NDV

I Junin virus (an arena virus responsible for hemorrhagic fever)

Source : httpsj ‘wwwpranaronxcom ’biog guideedeshuilesVessentielles leyhuileyessentieliese
efficacesrcontreriecoronaViru57vrairou7faux: See references 1 to 28 below.

 

To add meat to the bone, if you visit the National Center for Biotechnology Information (U.S.) :
I Vou will find nearly 225 000 references on ”essential oil."
Seezhttos: www ncbi.nlm.nih.eov search all ?term:essential%200ii
I Vou will find approximately 22 000 references on "essential oil 4- viral."
Seezhttps: www ncbi.n|m.nih.gov search ail/?termnessential%200ii%2D+%20virei

 

In addition, according to a brief email exchange with Mr. Pierre FRANCHOMME, a French
researcher, one ofthe leading experts in the field of medicinal essential oils, he informed me
that: a recent Indian study (March 31) highlights the potential activity of 1,8 cineole
(eucalyptol) on SAKS-Cov—Z, as lsuspected from my experience on other enveloped viruses.

Note‘ the molecule 1,8 cineole is found in high concentration in eucalyptus EOs.

NIH Production to ICAN_002080

Another study (2008) provided by Mr. Franchomme, shows a high antiviral activity of bay
laurel/leaf essential oil (Laums nobilis) on SARS-Cov, which appeared in November 2002 in
Guangdong province, China and which prevailed until 2004.
I Loizzo. M. R., Saab, A. M.. Tundis, R., Statti, G. A.. Menichini, F., Lampronti, I., Doerr.

Source : httas://0nline|ibrerv.wilev.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cbdv,200890045

   

since SARs-cov and SAKS-Cov-z (CDVID-lB) are close relatives, it is quite possible that Laurus
nobiils essential oil will be as effective on SARS-Cov-Z.

Here are two other studies that should be of interest to researchers, according to Mr.
FRANCHOMME:
I See reference 20 below Efﬁcacy of cineole in patients suffering from acute bronchitis: a
placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Cough 9, 25 (1013).
Source : htt s: doi.or 10.1186 17457997479725

Conclusions of this study : The effects a] Cineole in the treatment of acute bronchitis were
clearly measurable and could be proven after a treatment period of merely 4 days. This study
corroborates the fact that cineole actively and significantly reduces cough frequency after four
days. Therefore it has been shown to have a great socioeconomic impact.

I See also reference 22 below.
Also, according to Mr. FRANCHOMME, a clinical study on the treatment of essential oils in
patients with COVID-IS has just been undertaken in a hospital setting (100 patients), double
blind against placebo. I will know the results at the same time as everyone else and will inform

you.

Here Is a summary of Mr. FRANCHOMME’S analysis:

   
     

T e scienti ic community is aunc e in searc o a mira e rug in t e as et 0 mo ecu es
already known for other indications. Our design is to trust the plant world, a great provider of
remarkable molecules.

CONCLUSION
We need to think outside the box of allopathic medicine and synthetic drugs that offer no

solution and put pressure on our leaders to release funds for clinical research on the treatment
of patients suffering irom COVID-19 using essential oils, as advocated by Mr. Franchamme.

NIH Production to ICAN_002081

To this end, M. FRANCHOMME confirmed to me this: I am at the disposal of your authorities
to provide and explain a protocol based on essential oils.
His email address is: H!)

In terms of a double-blind placebo clinical study, there is, as of today, a huge cohort of
hospitalized patients, a significa nt portion of whom I suspect would be enthusiastic about
voluntary enrolments

For patients in critical care with a life-threatening prognosis, it Is undoubtedly possible, given
the circumstances, to bypass the usual research protocols and oﬁera last-resort treatment to
these patients in an attempt to save their lives, with their permission orthat oftheir legal
representatives in case of temporary or permanent incapacity.

Even if it doesn’t work, I don't think patients or their loved ones will blame your government
for trying everything, but if you don't, [wouldn't like to be in your shoes!

Cordially,

Benoit Ponton

First responders loaded a patient into an
ambulance from a nursing home where multiple people have contracted COID—19 in Chelsea, which has
the highest concentration of COVID-IB infections in the state.Scott Eisen/Getty

Nearly one third of 200 Chelsea residents who gave a drop of blood to researchers on the street this
weektested positive forantibodies linked to COVID-19, a startling indication of how widespread
infections have been in the denselv populated city.

Sixty—four residents who had a finger pricked in Bellingham Square on Tuesday and Wednesday had
antibodies that the immune system makes to fight off the coronavirus, according to Massachusetts
General Hospital physicians who ran the pilot study.

The 200 participants generally appeared healthy, but about half told the doctors they had had at least
one symptom oi COViD~15 In the past fourweeks.

Public health experts already knew Chelsea hadthe state’s highest rate of conﬁrmed COVlD-19 cases
and that the actual rate was probably higher. At least 39 residents have died from the virus, and 712 had
tested positive as of Tuesday, a rate of about 1,900 cases per 100,000 residents, or almost 2 percent.
Get Talking Points in your inboxAn afternoon recap ofthe day's most important business news,
delivered Monday through Friday.

But the Mass General researchers — who excluded anyone who had tested positive forthe virus in the
standard nasal swab test — found that 32 percent of participants have had COVIDAlS, and many didn’t
know it.

“I think It’s both good news and bad news," said Dr. John Iafrate, Vice chairman of MGH’s pathology
department and the study’s principal investigator. "The bad news is that there’s a raging epidemic in
Chelsea, and many people walking on the street don‘t know that they’re carrying the virus and that they
may be exposing uninfected individuals in their families."

“0n the goodnews side, it suggests that Chelsea has made its way through a good part of the
epidemic,” he said. "They' re probably further along than other towns.”

Scientists suspect that people who recoverfrom C0V|D719 may be at least temporarily immune from
catching it again Several biotechs and academic laboratories, in fact, are seeking blood donations from
people who have recovered, in the hopes that their antibodies can help create a treatment or vaccine.

Chelsea’s city manager, Thomas Ambrosino, said he learned the results of the pilot study Thursday in a
conference call with the researchers. He was dismayed, but not shocked.

“We've long thought that the reported numbers are vastly under-counting what the actual infection is,”
said Ambrosino, who has called his city the epicenter of the crisis in Massachusetts. "Those reported
numbers are based on positive COVID-19tests, and we’re all aware that a very, very small percentage of
people in Chelsea and everywhere are getting COVlD-19 tests.”

NIH Production to ICAN_002099

“Still,” he added, “it’s kind of sobering that 30 percent of a random group of 200 people that are
showing no symptoms are, in fact, infected. it’s all the more reason foreveryone to be practicing
physical distancing.”

Indeed, one ofthe doctors who tested volunteers in Bellingham Square said it's possible that some of
the people who had the antibodies are still contagious.

“Just because you have the antibodies doesn’t mean you’ve cleared the virus," said Dr. Vivek Naranbhai,
a clinical fellow in hematology and oncology.

Researchers said the test results, which had yet to be shared With state officials late Friday, couldn’t
necessarily be extrapolated for the citYs roughly 40,000 residents, Still, the ﬁndings provided a valuable
snapshot of a community that medical experts say is especially vulnerable to COVlD-19,

Chelsea covers only about two square miles, across the Mystic River from Boston. For generations, it has
attracted new immigrants, and about 65 percent of its residents are Latino. Many live in three-decker
houses, Ambrosino said, where it’s hard for people to isolate themselves. Many work in the hospitality
industry and health-related fields, where exposure to the virus is greater. And a lot of them must go to
work during the pandemic.

To get Chelsea residents to participate in the study 7 which included a questionnaire that was available
in English, Spanish, and Portuguese — investigators allowed them to rerriairl anonymous. But that meant
none of the participants received the results of the blood tests.

The doctors used a diagnostic device made by BioMedomics, of Morrisville, N.C., to analyze drops of
blood. It resembled an over-the~counter pregnancy test and generated results on the street in about 10
minutes. Although the test hasn't won the approval of the Food and Drug Administration, lafrate, the
principal investigator, said Mass. General determined it’s reliable.

within days, the physicians said, they hope to set up a medical tent outside the Mass. General Chelsea
Hoalthcarc Center to perform more antibodies tests with the device. The site will be located near a tent
set up weeks ago to run standard PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, tests for people with active
coronavirus symptoms. The latter uses nasal swabs to detect whether the virus Is present at the time;
the antibodies blood test reveals whether someone was intected 'in the past.

 

 

In addition to the new testing site. the researchers want to expand the study to other Massachusetts
cities and towns. For all ofthose studies, Mass, General doctors plan to obtain the identities of
participants so physicians can provide the results. But first the researchers need to come up with
guidelines for what participants should do if they test positive for antibodies

Dr. Dean Xerras, medical directorofthe Mass. General Chelsea Healthcare Centerand a co-investigator
in the study, said it illustrates why it’s essential for Chelsea and other communities to perform more
tests, regardless of whether they detect antibodies or the virus itself.

“Knowing how many people are infected is critical,” said Xerras, a longtime memberof the city's board
of health. ”We need to get them isolated. We need to get masks delivered to the city. We need to
launch more safe isolation sites. We need to be able to identify cases and then give people the things
they need to prevent perpetuation of the spread."

Chelsea and Revere officials, with helpfrom the state Department of Public Health and the
Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, secured almost 150 rooms at a Quality Inn in Revere
this week for residents who are recovering from COVID»19 and unable to isolate themselves at home,
according to Ambrosino. So far, only a handful of those rooms are occupied.

Governor Charlie Baker on Thursdaystaunchly defended the state’s handling ofthe escalating
outbreak in Chelsea, including asserting, without offering details, that city leaders have turned down
help from his administration.

The governor’s claim surprised ofﬁcials in Chelsea who told the Globe this week that the state, and even
heaith care providers. should have recognized the virus’s rapid spread through the city sooner.

The estimates on this page have been updated from an earlier report published in
December 2015 based on more recently available information. There is a trade-off
between timeliness and accuracy of the burden estimates. To provide timely burden
estimates to the public, clinicians, and public health decision»mal<ers, we use preliminary
data that may lead to over- or underestimates of the true burden. However, each
season‘s estimates will be finaliled when data on testing practices and deaths for that
season are available.

For the revised 2017-2018 estimates, we included additional information in our estimation
regarding inﬂuenza testing practices. The surveillance system used to estimate inﬂuenza—
related hospitalizations, FluSurv-NET, collects data on patients hospitalized with
laboratory-conﬁrmed influenza. influenza testing is done at the request of the clinician, but
not everyone is tested and inﬂuenza tests are not perfectly accurate. Thus, the reports of
laboratory-conﬁrmed influenza-related hospitalizations to FluSurv-NET are likely
underestimates of the true number of hospitalizations. To adjust for this, CDC collects data
annually from participating FluSurv<NET sites on the amount of influenza testing and the
type of test that is used at the site, and this information is used to correct for the possible
underestimate of Influenza-related hospitalizations. These testlng data are often not
available for up to two years after the end of an inﬂuenza season, and thus the estimates
are revised when additional testing data become available, For the original preliminary
2017-2018 burden estimates, data on testing practices during the 2014-2015 season were
used to make preliminary estimates because this season had the highest levels of testing
among the prior seasons for which data were available and resulted in the most
conservative (lowest) estimates of burden. More recent data from the 2016-17 season
show that inﬂuenza testing has been increasing among most age groups. The current
estimates were made using the highest testing rate for each agergroup during 2010711 to
2016-17 and has resulted in some burden estimates being lower than previously
estimatedz

Additionally, the method we use to estimate influenza»assoclated deaths relies on
additional data from FluSurv-NET and the National Center for Health Statistics (data on
cause of deaths and numbers of deaths that occur in versus outside the hospital) that are
also not available for up to two years after the end of the season being estimated.

The 2017-2018 estimates are still preliminary because not all of the required data are
currently available. when those data become available, these estimates will be updated
again and the results may change.

More answers to frequently asked questions about CDC’s influenza burden estimates are
available.

Wishing you well. Wanted you to be aware that we're releasing a report at a media
briefing this morning on how to "Box in COVID.” This plan includes prioritized expansion of
testing and building a corps of contact tracers in the US, using tried-and-true public health
measures at scale. There are four essential actions to box in the virus- 1) Expand testing; 2)
Isolate infected people to prevewt spread; 3) Identify contacts who may have exposed; 4)
Quarantine contacts. As you know, all four are crucial; if any one is lacking, the virus can
escape and spread explosively again. Success requires a massive expansion of our public
health capacity around the country and world.

The report is attached and can be downloaded here. Please let me know how we can
continue to be as supportive as possible.

All the best.

Washington, DC 20502

Dear Sir,

Many of us in the hyperbaric medicine community believe that there exists a simple
therapy to halt the inﬂammatory process and reverse the lung damage.

This process will also simultaneously provide many times over the amount of
oxygenation offered by the coma-inducing intubation
ventilator procedure

We are reaching out to our network to make contact with the airlines to secure the use of
an airplane with an onboard APU (Auxiliary Power Unit-—used to pressurize the aircraft)
for a month, to treat COVID-19 patients and show the effectiveness of the concept.

Initial testing indicates in one trial study 100% improvement while all others underway,
although small scale, are showing great beneﬁt at extremely low cost and patient risk.

So what is this new procedure? Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy or HBOT; ﬁrst used
successfully in 1918 for Spanish Flu cases HBOT is Viable and appears to work well but
we do not have the number of pressure vessels / HB chambers available to treat the
possibly

100,000+ who need the therapy now.

Several of us in our small community have arrived at the same idea in several
countries.

The idea is no longer new or unique.

Again, I am proposing use an aircraft as the pressure vessel. Every airplane with a
pressurized cabin (i.e., all commercial airline aircraft) is routinely pressurized to around
9 psi (some go higher) while they are on the ground, as part of their normal

airworthiness testing.

Myself and others have suggested that one or more of the hundreds of grounded aircraft
be provided to complete the trial test.

737 Max are not ﬂying but are a perfect pressure Vessel for the procedure.
Could you help us contact Boeing, the airlines or the militaiy?

N 0 aircraft modiﬁcation is required whatsoever so that is one of the issues off the table.

NIH Production to ICAN_002122

The aircraft remains parked on the ground with access for ambulatory patients via a
stairway. No jetway is required unless we expand this in the future for non-ambulatory
patients.

We would need to place standard DOT portable oxygen tank; in the cabin along with the
associated manifold, pressure regulator, ﬂow»meters and tubing.

Each patient will have his/ her own anesthesia mask and breathing circuit.
There is no cross contamination between patients or the cabin environment atmosphere
as each mask incorporates a Viral Filter Kit to help protect the technicians who are also

breathing from a secure, clean source,

All safety issues are addressed in the plan.

The same process, once proven could be utilized by our military and of course our Navy
who is experiencing possible outbreaks as we speak.

 

The Patriot Clinic in Oklahoma City is my personal charity where we have provided over
15,000 free HBOT treatments for our beloved vets and 30,000+ at cost or below.

We are not asking for money. Nor, am I selling anything in this effort. With the help of a
small group of supporters, ( Ralph Crafts 5: family ) my company is willing to provide
the equipment, training and technical support to begin the process.

Thank you for your ongoing service to our country, and thank you for reading and
considering my proposal.

1 sure would appreciate your help.
Semper Fi!

Sir:

As one old Marine to another Marine, this letter contains the “straight scoop," and is intended to
provide information that can help stop the spread of COVID-19, and ensure the continuity of
critical segments of govemment.

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) has been in use for over 100 years, and was the only
effective treatment for the 1918 ﬂu pandemic. HBOT is being used worldwide to treat a variety
ofserions diseases, and has been proven to he immediately effective in treating severe COVlD-
l9 cases. with a success rate close to 100%,

HBOT is simply breathing high-purity oxygen (92% or higher) for 60-90 minutes in a
pressurized environment (typically between 8 and 15psi—the higher pressure is about the same
pressure as doing a SCUBA dive to 33 feet). HBOT chambers can be 1-2 person sizes and
portable, up to lZ-seat chambers which are used for Navy operations. 1‘” I have a one-
person chamber in our home. and we can attest to its effectiveness in treating severe breathing
problems, like pneumonia, infections, and wounds.

The currently publicized and Widely accepted statement that there is no effective treatment for
COVID»19 is wrong. IIBOT treatments, usually just a single one-hour session, provide
immediate improvements in lung function, blood-oxygen levels, and organ recovery. L'nlike
respirators, which do more damage than good and are bastcally a death sentence, HBOT provides
an immediate path for recovery and healing.

A team ofvery experienced scientists and HBOT experts have developed a concept that will
enable the effective treatment of large numbers of people by using some of the thousands of
grounded commercial aircraft as large HBOT chambers.

I'm an old Marine Corps jet pilot, and we use our KID
so I have the professional contacts to confirm and verify the efﬁcacy
of the concept.

NIH Production to ICAN_002124

Every airplane with a pressurized cabin (i.e., all airline aircraﬁ) is routinely pressurized to
around 9psi (some go higher) while they are on the ground. as part of their normal airworthiness
testing

We have equipment staged and ready to go now, to treat 25 COVID-l9 patients at a timciwe
need an airplane, and we can be treating people and saving lives in about 36 hours.

The aircraft we need remain parked on the ground, no modiﬁcations are needediwe will simply
place portable oxygen tanks in the cabin with the associated tubing, manifold, and pressure
regulators. and each patient will have his/her own anesthesia mask.

There is no cross contamination between patients, because everyone is breathing oxygen from
their own personal mask.

We are reaching out to our contacts in the airlines to ask for the use of an airplane and APU
(Auxiliary Power Unitiused to pressurize the aircraft) for a month, to treat COVID—l9 patients
and show the effectiveness ot'the concept.

We could do the same thing with a single military transport aircraft (many of which have been
conﬁgured for medical use).

As a Marine, and with my knowledge of HBOT, the recent death ofthe Theodore Roosevelt
sailor is particularly upsetting, knowing that a couple ofSenior Chiefs or Marine Master
Sergeants could have conﬁgured an aircraft in Guam in a couple ofhours and be treating all the
sailors from the carrier,

We are not asking for money—my wife and I are paying for all the required equipment and
support personnel.

I-IBOT chambers are easily implemented and supported—you could have one in your ofﬁce
(ours is 8’ long and 34" in diameter when pressurized) and it would only take a couple ofhours
to train your corpsmeu to operate it, I don’t know ofa better guarantee of continuity in the
current pandemic.

Please note that ”I“? I have no ﬁnancial or political interests in the HBOT treatment

save many lives.

In the 1980's he was Consulting Editor ofthe Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology,
Editor of Reviews in Pure and Applied Pharmacological Sciences, and Associate
Editor of the lntemational Journal of Adolescent Medicine and Health. From 1990-
2004, he was a consultant on emergency planning and management at Israel’s
National Police Headquarters with Nitzav Mishneh Danny Fisher.

 

Chloroguine, an antimalarial drug, is now being used to treat Covid- 19. Its
mechanism was found in the 1970’s to inhibit thromboxane

Anthony S. Fauci, MD.
Director, NIAID

Dear Dr. Fauci:

As a fellow graduate of Regis High School _ and very active
alumnus, I am writing to you out of deep concern for our nation. I am
reading reports in The NY Times that President Trump may be considering
firing you for telling the truth about the negative consequences of delays in
mobilizing the American response to the coronavirus threat. The Times had
run articles in recent days detailing the pertinent facts that place the blame

NIH Production to ICAN_002132

for this delay squarely on President Trump. We can reasonably infer that
significant loss of life and ﬁnancial harm resulted from this delay.

The mission of Regis was to mold young men with leadership potential to
be "men for others" in the Jesuit tradition‘ To achieve that goal Regis also
sought to hone our intellectual talents and imbue us with Christian morality
to succeed throughout our lives in a persistent pursuit of excellence, which
embodies the truth. A mission to relentlessly pursue and proclaim the
truth.

The fact that you have consistently and courageously pursued that mission
during one of the darkest times in our history explains the extraordinary
admiration in which you are held by millions of Americans. You have won
their confidence, which has enabled so many to make exquisite sacrifices
to win this crucial battle. People will follow heroes, which is precisely how
the vast majority views you.

I am writing because I want you to know how important you are to America.
We cannot lose you and we can not lose the value of truth. Truth must
prevail or our precious democracy is in grave peril.

Consequently. and I know I speak for the vast majority of Americans whose
decency is beyond question, if Donald Trump seeks your removal, please
resist for the sake of our nation. An appeal to the populace will not go
unanswered. Religious leaders will ﬂock to your defense, as will the media
and leading political leaders, including Biden and Cuomo. Republicans can
not afford to alienate what you stand for. Jeopardizing the Catholic vote
would be suicide.

In closing, know how proud all Regians are of you. You will always be an
inspiration to those who understand the value of service to others.

Our prayers are with you.

Activity Type: Strategic Plan

Summing: A new strategic research plan from the National Institutes of Health aims to build on
— and accelerate — new and ex'sting research efforts to prevent, diagnose, and treat COVI D-19,
as well as understand the underlying causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-Z). The Plan prioritizes research to improve fundamental
knowledge of SARS’COVaZ virus and COVID719 disease, develop diagnostics and assays,
characterize and test therapeutics, as well as develop safe and effective vaccines targeted toward
decreasing disease incidence, mitigating morbidity, and prevention mortality from this disease.

Item 2: NIH study validates decontamination methods for re-use of N95 respirators
Activity Type: Significant scientific finding

Summag: NIAID/NlH-tunded study shows that N95 respirators can be decontaminated
effectively and maintain functional integrity for up to three uses. Researchers tested the
decontamination of small sections of N95 filter fabric that had been exposed to SARS-CoV-Z.
Decontamination methods tested included vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHF), 70-degree Celsius
dry heat, ultraviolet light. and 70% ethanol spray, All four methods eliminated detectable viable
virus from the N95 fabric test samples. The results will be posted on a preprint server (timing
TBD). The findings are not yet peer-reviewed butare being shared to assist the public health
response to COVIDJS.

Impact on COVlD-19 Pandemic Response: Study shows that respirators could be used multiple
times (23 times depending on decontamination method)

Colleagues,

As discussed this afternoon. please find attached the POC Sign-up sheet (tab 1; tabs 2-3 list the various
proposals by category. theme, and IC), the IC-specific proposals, and the economic recovery
proposals. We ask that you please complete the POC sign-up and send it to Jordan Gladman

completed spreadsheet to the Chairs for each of the themes and post it on the ICD SharePoint site. The
individual proposals are imbedded in the pdf as folders sorted by theme. Ifyou feel yourproposal would
fit better with a different working group, please feel free to engage with them.

We ask that, once the POCs have been have been identified, you quickly assemble to begin refining and
synergizing your proposals. Each Chairshould coordinate with their group to develop a 2 page max
summary of the theme’s research, along with a single combined budget. The summary should integrate
the IC proposals as much as possible, however, it is ﬁne (for valid/justifiable reasons) to describe a few
unique projects that fall under the theme as well. That is, if they don’t make sense to integrate, you
don't have to, but please be sure to include them in the summary. These summaries should be sent to
Larry and me lchordan Gladman) by noon on April 20. We will build off these summaries to generate a
document for Francis' review, which we ultimately hope will be informative as we prepare fora

The ask in short:

0 April 20 at 12 pm —chairs to send a 2 page summary of their theme (with combined budget)

the mission of the American Society forMicrobiology (ASM) to promote and advance the microbial

Accelerating basic research is key to ASM’s mission— it is where cure and prevention begin. It is
impressive how rapidly research on SARS—CoV-Z lCOVlD-tB has advanced injust a few weeks, but
easily accessing new and relevant research has been a challenge for basic researchers. When ASM‘s
Council on Microbial Sciences held a COVlD~19 summit to identify the most signiﬁcant scientiﬁc work on
the virus, the coronavirus researchers and clinical mlcrobiologists raised the need for the scientiﬁc
community to curate important COVlD-19 research.

ASM is excited to announce the launch ofthe COVlD-19 Research Registry, a platform curated
and vetted by experts in the ﬁeld of virology and related disciplines to provide immediate access
to top COVlD-19 research.

lain proud that Lynn Enqulst. Ph.D,, Henry L. Hillman Professor in Molecular Biology, Princeton
University and former ASM President. will serve as Chief Curator for this Registry. Dr. Harold Varrnus,
Lewis Thomas University Professor of Medicme. Weill Cornell Medicine has agreed to Join us as Chief
Consultant on the protect.

We are honored to have the following as Assistant Curators-in-Chiei:
u Rozanne M. Sandriﬂoldin, Ph.D.. Chancellofs Professor, Microbiology 8. Molecular Genetics.
University of California, Irvine and Editor-in-Chief of ASM's Journal of Virology

- Vaughn Cooper, Ph.D., Professor, Microbiology & Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh,
and current ASM Board member

The entire curatorial board is listed on the Registry site.

ASM is proud to add this initiative to our ongoing efforts, Through its capillary network of clinical
microbiologists around the country and the world. ASM has accelerated communication and cleared
roadblocks to ramp up SARS-Cov-Z testing, We continue to work closely With our dedicated colleagues,
the indefatigable clinical mlcrobiologists manning the front lines in hospitals and testing labs during this
unprecedented global emergency We send our thanks—and admiration--to these ASM members who
are contributing directly to saving lives in this perilous time.

Our COVID-19 resource page provides important ASM updates and current information on the
coronavirus. We are also working With the news media to provide authoritative ASM experts and reliable
material on the microbiology of viral epidemics. ASM journals is also providing free access to more

than 50 research articles published over the last vear in our 16 scholarlv iournals and expediting review
for submitted papers related to coronavirus, ensuring that new research is quickly made available to the
scientiﬁc community.

We are hoping that researchers will ﬁnd the COVlD-19 Research Registry a useful resource. We look
forward to your comments, questions or suggestions, Since your inputwnl be critical for improvmg this
platform and making it useful for the scientiﬁc community. All feedback can tie sent to

As discussed this afternoon, please find attached the FCC sign-up sheet (tab 1; tabs 2-3 list the various
proposals by category, theme, and IC], the IC-specific proposals, and the economic recovery

proposals, We ask that you please complete the PDC sign-up and send it to Jordan Gladman

completed spreadsheet to the Chairs for each of the themes and post it on the ICD SharePoint site. The
individual proposals are imbedded in the pdf as folders sorted by theme Ifyou feel your proposal would
fit better with a different working group, please feel free to engage with them

We ask that, once the POCs have been have been identified, you quickly assemble to begin reﬁning and
synergizing your proposals. Each Chair should coordinate with theirgroup to develop a 2 page max
summary of the theme’s research, along with a single combined budget, The summary should integrate
the IC proposals as much as possible; however, it is fine (for valid/iustifiable reasons) to describe a few
unique prnjertc that fall nnrlerthe theme acwell That is, if they don’t make sense tn integrate, ynu
don’t have to, but please be sure to include them in the summary These summaries should be sent to
Larry and me lchordan Gladman) by noon on April 20. We will build off these summaries to generate a
document for Francis' review, which we ultimately hope will be informative as we prepare fora
potential fourth supplements

The ask in short:

induslry and [he acddeiniL community that is largely supported by NIH, particularly NIAID in the
context of COBID-19. It Is the functional equivalent of a National Strategy. We at NIAID and to
some extent other institutes are leveraging our vast clinical trials networks that we built for
other infectious diseases, particularly, but not exclusively HIV/AIDS, to provide the capacity to
conduct clinical trials (NlH»sponsored as well as industry-sponsored) for both vaccines and
therapeutics for COVlD-19. For your interest, I am attaching a copy (not yet released) of the

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Therapy for COVID-19; Results of Trial in Italy

Melissa,

I wanted to expand a bit on the COVIDrlS therapy I mentioned and provide some
information about the man who is developing it. Hoping that you can get this into the right
hands, as it seems like a very promising lead in this fight.

The therapy, invented by Professor Claudio De Simone, has shown extremely encouraging
results in a preliminary trial at the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the University “La Sapienza"
in Rome, Italy. Professor De Simone convinced the doctors there to start a trial on patients
affected by COVlDrl9. Consideringthe excellent results obtained, the number of patients
enrolled is increasing day after day. Ourfirm became aware ofthesc results directly from
Professor De Simone, who has been a client of our managing partner, Jeremy Schulman,
since 2015.

The formulation employed in these patiens at the La Sapienza Infectious Diseases Clinic is
manufactured in France and known as ”SIVOMIXX.” The product is a specialized blend of
eight different freezedried bacteria with considerable antiviral and antieinflammatory
activity. Patients admitted to the clinic at La Sa pienza, presenting as positive for COVIDAIQ
and with the typical symptoms of the disease, are being treated by oral bacteriotherapy
utilizing SIVOMIXX In each case, SIVOMIXX administration was followed by a dramatic
improvement in theirconditionsu The key takeaways are that use of SIVOMIXX correlated
with fewer deaths (zero in the treated group), fewer patients transferred to the ICU, and a
dramatically reduced risk of patient intubations. The sponsors of the trial using SIVOMIXX
are now beginning to enroll patients With severe cases who have been admitted to the ICU.

Attached to this email is a confidential dossier about the SIVOMIXX product and a
summary of the ongoing study. Upon request, I am also able to send you an Excel file
containing the raw data from the study. so NIH can review them, with the understanding
that this should be treated as "highly confidential.” Since the clinical trial is continuing in
Italy, we expect to have results covering additional patients on a rolling basis. The
researchers conducting the study intend to publish their results in the coming weeks,
However, considering the pandemic and the lack of effective treatment options, we want
to make NIH aware of Professor De Simone’s therapy withoutany delay.

SIVOMIXX is a relatively new formulation developed by Professor De Simone, currently in
limited commercial production at a manufacturing facility in France. Professor De Simone
has sufficient supply available to utilize with 100-150 COVID-19 patients immediately.
Professor De Simone could, on his own, arrange a small-scale supply to use with hundreds
ofadditional patients in the United States. He is willing to provide his current inventory of
the product to the United States government. He expects that the Trump administration
could quickly confirm the efficacy of SIVOMIXX to significantly improve symptoms of
COVID~19 and reduce the duration of patient hospital stays. After that, Professor De
Simone is willing to collaborate with the administration to bring a large—scale production of
SIVOMIXX for use throughout the United States, Italy [where he was born), and
Switzerland (where he lives). Professor De Simone already has ongoing partnerships with a

NIH Production to ICAN_002158

number of manufacturing companies, including one in the United States, for the
production of another one of his products (Visbiome, referenced below). With appropriate
guidance and instruction from the Trump administration, we believe the U.S.
manufacturing companies could re-tool to produce SIVOMIXX on a large scale within
several weeks.

Professor De Simone (more information about him below) and Jeremy will do whatever it
takes to bring this critical therapy to as many Americans as possible on an urgent basis.
Jeremy can be reached at anytime on his cell phone— ‘MW

Thanks so much for passing this on,
Best,

Jake

About Professor De Simone. Professor De Simone is a world-renowned expert in
gastroenterology and the inventor of several highly successful probiotic medical foods.
Until 2010, he was an Associate Professor for the Infectious Diseases Group at the
Department of Medicine and Surgery ofthe University of L'Aquila, Italy. Subsequently, he
was appointed Head of the Infettious Disease Department and Director of the AIDS
Coordination Group of the Abruzzi region, Italy. He is currently a retired Professor of
Internal Medicine, still collaborating with the University, and a Fellow of the American
Gastroenterology Association. Professor De Simone's research specialties have been in the
fields of immunonathogenesis of infectious diseases. He has published the results oi his
research activities in over 200 scientiﬁc articles, reviews, case reports, and book chapters.
Professor De Simone is both a researcher and a medical practitioner. He tests his
laboratory hypotheses in the university hospital clinic on patients With serious diseases. He
was responsible for controlling the AIDS pandemic in Italy‘s Abruzzi region in the 1990's.

Products developed according to Professor De Simone‘s knowihow have shown positive
results in patients with serious diseases. One of his signature formulations, known as the
“De Simone Formulation," is now sold in the United States as “Visbiome.” The De Simone
Formulation has been the subject of more than 70 published human clinical trials
demonstrating its efficacy in managing severe gastrointestinal symptoms from such
diseases as ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, and liver diseases Concerning pouchitis, the De
Simone Formulation is recognized by the world's professional gastroenterology societies as
a "standard of care,“ an achievement that no other probiotic substance previously has
attained. The De Simone Formulation became the “gold standard" in its therapeutic class.
Its role in patient care has been endorsed in the guidelines published by the American
Gastroenterology Association (“AGA”), the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization
("ECCO"), and the British Society of Gastroenterology, as well as in the New England
Journal of Medicine.

members. had an opportunity to visit you at NIH.

We are grateful to you and your team for the most important contribution to
establishing US—Georgia biomedical collaboration that signiﬁcantly increased our
country’s research and practical capacities. Your personal role in combating HIV
and other emerging epidemics such as SARS. MERS, Zika, Ebola. cannot be
overestimated I am confident that your leading role in this fight against COVID-19

the globe,

We closely follow your brieﬁngs and interviews on COVID-19 (including recent
very interesting conversation with Dr Howard Bauchner at JAMA) and as always
your views are very apt and to the point. We fully agree that the approaches you
suggest are the most effective way to defeat the pandemic. Most importantly your
recommendations are applicable not only to the United States. but to other countries
as well and we eagerly take them into consideration while planning our strategies
here in my country of Georgia.

I would like to use this opportunity to update you on COVlD-l9 situation in my
home country of Georgia: The country quickly responded to this threat ﬁrst by
stopping ﬂights with China inJanuary, followed by more strict measures after the
first case was diagnosed on F ebnlary 26. These measures included national

Hi Tony,

Greetingsrrom—

It's been good to see all the calls for ranping up a public health workforce to manage contact tracing
and other aspects of the second phase of the response I wanted to let you know that Peter Kilmarx has
been calling for the formation of a “U.S. COVlD-19 Response Corps" since March 21 (unrelated to NIH
work). FEMA could hire thousands of temporary workers quickly with existing authorities and funding
CDC could provide training and technical assistance The workforce would be deployed to and managed
by state and local health departments at their request, There’s a lot of enthusiasm for this from Jeff
Duchin in Seattle, to Tom Frieden, CSIS, ASTHO, and 40 members of Congress (bicameral, bipartisan)
who sent a letter to FEMA asking them to do this. The 7,000+ recently evacuated Peace Corps
volunteers could be one recruiting source. Another approach is for CDC to fund state and local
authorities for those who are able to hire at this speed and scale. There’s more information in the string
below,

This workforce issue is now such a critical part of the response, I wanted to share with you what
we've learned and offer to help in any way.

Tony, all of NIH is so proud of your leadership and rooting for you to getthis outbreak under control.
Please keep up fight and let us know ifand how we can help.

Warm wishes,
Roger

Hi all,

2. WaPo article: “A plan to defeat coronavirus ﬁnally emerges, but it’s not from the White House"
covers the lHU/ASTHO plan and notes: ”Experts [BIS] have proposed transforming the Peace
Corps into a national response corps that could perform many tasks. including contact tracing.“
[Not quite accurate. Peace Corps would be unchanged, but the evacuated volunteers would be
hired into COVID-lQ response.1

6. Mark McClellan responded to my email yesterday: “I’d suggest adding outreach to mayors and

I understand legislation is in the works, but don’t have details.

. No news from FEMA or indication to my knowledge that they are planning a substantial ramping
up of staffing.

Subject: RE: CDVlD-19 Response Corps

+ John Auerbach, president and CEO of Trust for America‘s Health

Thanks all for the robust discussion. Some updates:

1. ASTHO sent the attached memo to Congress today RE: Contact Tracing Workforce calling for
”flexible long term and emergency supplemental funding to expand the. . . contact tracing
workforce” at state, local, and related levels. It recommends against using FEMA for hiring.
ASTHO notes that currently there are only 2,200 DIS nationwide while JHU estimates that
100,000 contact tracing employees are needed to address COVID-19 In the Immediate future.
The memo mainly calls for 1) 535 5 emergency funding through the CDC Crisis Cooperative
Agreement to eligible jurisdictions, plus 2) a $4.5 B annual Public Health Infrastructure Fund.

2. Resolve to Save Lives (Tom Frieden) is advocating for CDC to have the needed authority and
political support to provide training, systems, and technical expertise, while the CDC Foundation
and ASTHO provide staffing through direct assistance to health departments.

3. CDC could support curriculum development and training through the National Network of STD
Clinical Prevention Training Centers httpsﬂnnptcorgl and/or TE Centers of Excellence
htt s: www.cdci ov tb education to coe default.htm

NIH Production to ICAN_002171

My take: We share the goal of rapidly and substantially ramping up the public health workforce and
should emphaslze that message. It would be very challenglng for any of these potential approaches to
reach 100,000 inthe short term. ldon‘t have any special allegiance to FEMA, but theirtraditional role in
emergency response is quickly hiring many thousands of workers, They are hiring now, but not at this
speed and scale. CDC and FEMA should have an MOU through which FEMA can hire staﬂand detail to
CDC , but they don't seem to be pursuing. One model could be FEMA detailing staff to state and local
authorities to manage the hiring process. FEMA is proud of their ability to get people from “door to
desk” in one week. This would not be "federaliling” contact tracing or other public health activities. in
all cases, the invitations and the oversight would come from the state and local authorities, who are
best able to decide what mechanisms) work for them. Lastly. this concept includes more than contact
tracing. Congresswoman Susan Brooks (R-IN] in her podcast Wednesday noted that the state 211 call
line has gone from 2,000 to 25000-35300 calls per day. So this concept would still have a role even if
not direct public health functions.

Subject: COVID-IQ Response Corps - CDC calling for public health army

Thanks Craig. This NEJM article is mainly about heath care workers, but does mention other roles in
social support.

Important development: CDC’s Bob Redfield is calling for a public health army for contact tracing after
this acute phase:
httoszllwww.npr.ore/sections/health-shots/2020/04/10/831200054/cdc-director-verv-aeeressive-
contact—tradng-needed—for—u—s—to—return—to-normal

it turns out that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been working on a plan to allow the
US. to safely begin to scale back those policies. CDC Director Robert Redfield spoke with NPR on
Thursday, saying that the plan relies on not only ramped-up testing but "very aggressive" contact tracing
of those who do test positive for the coronavirus, and o major scale-up of personnel to do the necessary
work.

NIH Production to ICAN_002172

I‘m not sure CDC has the authority, capacity, or political support to hire an army at this time. This is a
traditional FEMA role. CDC can provide training and technical assistance.

FEMA. Racing to Provide Virus Relief; is Running Short on Front-Line Staff

 

WASHINGTON — The Federal Emergency ManagementAgency, the ofﬁce leading the federal
government’s coronavirus response nationwide, is running short of employees who are trained in some
of its most important front-line jobs, according to interviews with current and former officials

At the same tlme, the agency has been forced to halt a major nlrlng InltIat/ve, and has closed traInIng
facilities to avoid spreading the infection.

The number of available personnel who are qualified to lead field operations has fallen to 19 from 44 in
less than six weeks, and staff membershave been pulled from responding to other disasters, but training
centers in Maryland and Alabama have been shuttered until mid-May. In addition, an effort to recruit
new employees called “Harness" is on hold, according to aseniar administration ofﬁcial with wrest
knowledge of FEMA‘s operations , . . .

Craig Fugote, who ran the agency during the Obama administration, said FEMA’s ability to deploy
enough people was a signiﬁcant challenge "Can it be done? Yeah,” Mr. Fugate said. ”Will it be pretty?
Not”

duplicative of USPHS Ready Reserve Corps which is now authorized but not being implemented
(to my knowledge) and would be different profile, i.e., USPHS has physicians, nurses, engineers,
etc.

- Telcon Saturday with CDC COVlD-19 Chief Medical Officer. Confirms many are thinking about
the workforce issue. Notes that CDC unlikely to ”own,” but great suggestion to engage CDC-
funded National Network of STD Clinical Prevention Training Centers for training.
httpsﬁnnptcorgl wrth eight centers around the country. CRC concept may be brought to
national response discussions with FEMA in Washington DC.

I FEMA contacts report they are hiring RPCVs, but do not report major speed up or scale up.
FEMA recruiting email attached.

- Charles shared Vanessa Kerry OpEd emphasizing same themes: response workforce and jobs:
https://www.bostonhcrald.com/2020/04lol/massachusetts general hospital infectious

disease-teameca |Isaonestate-ttharnessepeoglergowerl

 

Next steps:

Executive — support/impetus to FEMA to increase speed and scale
Legislation — new appropriations for FEMA or CDC if needed
National advocacy— media, opinion leaders

Demand signal state and local authorities requests
Implementation and management details working out

Overall goal: Greatly increase COVID-19 response workforce to control disease and provide jobs. A
COVlD-19 Response Corps would be a (big) part of solution. RPCV ideal first cadre for CRC.

v|:\{y

Hi all,

Big news. Herewlth is a letter signed by 40 members of Congress asking FEMA, Peace Corps, and
AmeriCorps to form a ”COVID-19 Response Corps." This is now in the public domain. Press release
forthcoming.

Please save the time for Zoom call 8 am tomorrow on next steps.

The National Peace Corps Association is hoping to create and fund a group that draws on the evacuated
volunteers and their skills to respond to the [UV/019 crisis in the United States. Workers would take on
work like tracing the contacts a] diagnosed individuals, monitoring the health of those in quarantine and
staffing call cen ters, An agency such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.$. Centers for
Disease Control and Preven than or Amer/Corps could patentlally manage the group, says Blumhorst, who
has been advocating for the project. Salaries could comefram funding that's already been allotted to the
COVlD-19 response but hasn 't yet been spent. The NPCA has discussed the idea with the offices of several
members of Congress that are receptive and supportive, Blumhorst says, and they're planning to speak
with more congresspeaple and federal agencies and also hope to draw public attention to this potential
project.

Subject: INFO: Update on COVlD-IQ Response Corps

Hi all and thanks for your support for a U.S. COVlD-19 Response Corps engaging returned Peace Corps
volunteers (RPCV). The latest (March 25) Z-page concept note attached.

Updates

1. Steve is working on getting the OpEd out in press and/or on CSIS website by Tuesday. We’ll let
you know.

2. Glenn and Charles have found very good receptivity on the Hill.

3. I've had a couple very good calls with FEMA folks at senior levels (extensive RPCV network).
They are already reaching out to RPCV and are well funded. They can get an RPCV on board in a
week. They have a few dlf‘ferent hlrlng mechanlsms that would be appropriate. The scale and
speed need to be ramped up substantially.

4. We reached out to contacts at national mayors and governors associations with no reply. Also
no reply from CDC (Jernigan and Schuchat).

Next steps — when OpEd comes out. amplify multiple levels to publicize and create demand.
The need for this is great. The feasibility looks very good.
Please share your suggestions,

Thanks to all,
PK

Thanks Charles. This isvery helpful,

I’ve updated the concept note — attached. Now a tonpager. Added training and prevention bullet.
Decreased the numbers and budget based on feed back to date. Draft OpEd forthcoming.

Grateful if others can advocate as theyare able (and others of us are not).
Glenn — please add anything on your meetings on the hill yesterday, the FEMA call, or advocacy plans.
My takeaway l5 that a FEMA disaster corps or FEMA»Americorps Corps is feasible.

. Call yesterday with Glenn and former FEMA staff: George Haddow and Micheal Coen

o FEMA Corps is a partnership of FEMA and Americorps with about 1.2004300
members, Part of Americorps. FEMA pays 100%. Mainly you nger. lower»skilled
supervised work.

0 FEMA reservist disaster corps has 3,000-4,000 members. Mostly shorter—term
deployments as temp employees. Many retired military. Can be activated with
State of Emergency declarations,

a FEMA currently has sent 3-4 liaisons to each state. Disaster corps not activated.

0 Onboarding 5,000 would be a big lift. Peace Corps has seconded staff to other
agencies in past, so this could be an option.

0 Only private sector partner for FEMA is Red Cross. Not recommended for this.

More input:
- Jen Kates (KFF) and hercolleague Josh Michaud 7 "think it is a great idea”
0 Tom Frieden -“lt's a good idea."
a Robynn Leldig, Manager, Strategic Initiatives, Resolve To Save Lives- "Compelling
idea and worth exploring”
- Concern about risk to RPCVs, training and oversight needed
I Lack of PPE, best to focus on tasks that don’t need PPE
- Resentment of current staff worried about threat to their jobs
- Fairness: should open to others - Americorps, VISTA, CDC PHAP, CSI'E
fellows, USAID Global Health Fellows
- Management absorptive capacity limited at CDC. ConsiderASTHO/
NACCHO or PHI,

Thanks Craig. This looks very comprehensive and something a trained RPCV (returned Peace Corps

Glenn — good luck on the Hill today. Will be eager to hear about the reception.
some feedback from others:

. John Monahan (Georgetown) —- "Very creative, kudos!”

NIH Production to ICAN_002182

0 Try to get authority on one of these COVID»19 response bills for returning Peace
Corps folks to be redeployed notwithstanding other provisions of law.

0 Explore whether CRC could be incorporated into the programs FEMA already has
to bring in short-term employees to help with emergency responses.

0 Some functions (home-delivered meals, staffing call centers, homeless populations
and shelters) would more sense to supplement programs run by Americorps.

0 Cost seems high.

0 Scott Dowell (Gates Foundation) — ”A good and important idea"

0 Need a massive surge in the public health and community testing workforce over
the coming months.

0 They are considering engaging the 30,000 medical students through AMSA
(American Medical Student Association).

c Tom lnglesby (Johns Hopkins) — "A fantastic idea and am very supportive"

0 Important issue to be worked through: How to address risk to individuals involved?
(My response: training, equipping, and monitoring. Will add to next iteration of
concept note. Note that Singapore has had no infections in HCW and in China after
January/Wuhan, most HCW infections were from home, not from work.)

0 Tom's working on concept to engage presumably immune COVlD-lS survivors (as
was done with Ebola).

- Jeremy Konyndyk (CGD) — “Great idea.”

0 Need to think creatively about how to expand the public health workforce for the
coming 18 months, especially for tasks like contact tracing. We‘ll need to view CDC
and local health dept folks not as boots on the ground but rather as force
multipliers - sharing their skills with others and mentoring/managing larger teams
to extend their reach.

Re LTCs--attached is a draft document listing all the capabilities that need to be in place for
LTCFs to respond to Covid-19.

Developing and disseminating guidance aimed at LTCFs is relatively easy--the failures are

This is one area where assistance would be valuable.

Thanks all for our call and support for this concept. Please let me know any critical additions or
corrections to these notes.

- JeffDuchin (Seattle) noted multiple possible roles in contact tracing, mitigation with
homeless and incarcerated. adverse consequences of social distancing, infection control
support, alternative care slte coordination, lab specimen collection and transport, He
shared concerns about infection prevention and their PPE shortage. CDC had 40 people
deployed, but they departed. Longer deployments (e.g., >90 days) needed to validate
onboarding and training effort. He will follow up with more detail on potential roles and
numbers.

0 Angela Dunn (Utah) agreed with roles in contact tracing, also stafﬁng a call center, rural
outreach and specimen collection. She said Utah was not a current priority for FEMA and
CDC was conducting a transmission study. She shared Jeff's concern about the onboarding
effort.

0 Cindy Burnett (Utah) mentioned the need for social support in rural settings.

- Craig Conover(||linois) added that for them the long-term care centers and homeless
populations were prioritv concerns. It would be feasible and helpful to have staff able to
collect specimen swabs.

0 Charles Holmes (Georgetown) made an analogy to community health workers in Zambia
and how much can be accomplished and enhanced with tablet-based approaches, work-
flow apps, and video instructions.

- Steve Morrison (CSIS) emphasized the importance ofﬁnding an organizational home,
mentioning potential challenges for both CDC and FEMA. He noted timing of response
packages being considered, the hunger for creative ideas, and urgency for this to be
brought forward. He noted potential champions, listed with others below. He thinks the
Peace Corps connection is a compelling factor.

o Glen Elumhorst (NPCA) expressed his support and insights on potential champions, e.g.,
three RPCV in the house. He is goingto Capitol Hilltomorrow.

- Jody Olsen (Peace Corps) (prior to the call) expressed interest and noted that Peace Corps
has no authority to operate in the United States. (The possibility ofan Executive Order

NIH Production to ICAN_002184

detailing returned volunteers from Peace Corps to state and local authorities was
mentioned by others on the call,) She also noted that Barbara Stewart, Director of CNCS
(AmeriCorps and VISTA) has been inviting RPCVs to join,

Next steps:

1. Revise document (done, attached) to be shared with subject matter experts and potential
champions. (There was not an exact delineation of who would share with whom‘ I will aim
to CC: orask for help with some contacts.)

2, Will draft Op—Ed in next Zdays.

duplication. Report back useful feedback.

originally funded by the Gates Foundation. We thoughtthe last two breakthroughs, in particular, may be

Subject: COVID 19: Possible main cause of fatalities, it could be not respiratory

Good morning Dr Fauci,

Ive been following you on COVlD briefings from the White House every night. I trust your experience,
orofessionality and above all your wisdom in these weeks.

Whilel am a mechanical engineer and i run my food company fro living, I have been interested and
passionate to the global fight to the Coronavirus.

SUGGESTION. Could it be possible that people die of gulmonag micro thrombosis rather than
respiratory issues? If this is the case, this is more a cardiovascular issue than a respiratory, and
ventilation or intubation do not count as much as, Instead, to give patients some drugs to prevent the
thrombosis, such as ANTI-INFIAMMATORIES. If you ventilate a lung where blood doesn't get there, may
be it’s useless! In fact 9 out of 10 die. ll the problem were cardiovascular and not respiratory, then it
could be a venous microthrombosis and not pneumonia that determines fatality. And why are thrombi
formed? Because there is an inflammation that inducesthrombosis through a complex but well-known
pathophysiological mechanisms.

I know this thesis is right the contrary of some recommendations that several doctors all over the world
(in China first) had made so far: no ibuprofene, no anthlbiotics etc etc,
But I believe that some researches on the cardiovascular problem induced by inﬂammation would be

worth doing it.

An apology for my English.
Thank you for your attention,

Stay healthy!
Kindest regards

Nicola

Subject: RE: Comparison of COVID-19 statistics in US vs. China
Dear Dr Redfield and Dr Fauci,
After some hesitatIon, I demoted to write you this message anyway and hope you don’t mind.

I am concerned about the recent fight between the US and WHO because it may adversely impact the
current global efforts in controlling the spread of COVID»19. As we all know, US has been leading WHO’s
efforts for decades and essentially WHO’S role is mostly coordinating responses in low: and middle-
income countries with supportfrom the US and other high income countries. Frankly I was looking for
leadership from the US CDC rather than WHO when I was doing Q“)

. Until COVID-19 is controlled in all countries,
the infection could come back to hit us in this country again. Therefore it is now the worst time to
undermine WHO’S global coordinating capabilities.

What I learned from my former colleagues and friends in M“) where I attended medical school
and obtained my MSc in epidemiology might offer some explanation for the differences In COVID- 19
statistics in US vs China. Please find attached a couple ofarticles published by my former colleagues“!

I, of which the 1“ attachment' Is a more updated version

I First, the maximum lockdown In Wuhan that started on January 23 and also in the rest of the
entire Hubei province of 59 million people during the subsequent 2-3 days, coupled with
maximum efforts in early identification. immediate isolation of identified infected individuals
and close monitoring of contacts, did work and had to work according to epidemiological
principles. China did it by invoking level 1 public health response that was historically reserved
for smallpox, plague or cholera, which essentially enabled the entire countryto be completely
locked down for several weeks. Many VIIIages and townshlps set up checkpoints to refuse

NIH Production to ICAN_002197

anyone to come in or go out. a driver from Hubei had to stay on an inter-provincial highway for
20 days surviving by begging instant noodles from people policing exits; all front doors of
residents in a township in Hubei were sealed by local government officials and volunteers to
prevent them from getting out of their houses.

a Second, there must be under—reporting of COVlD—19 cases and deaths because the public
health and hospital systems in Wuhan and a few other hardest hit municipalities were
overwhelmed for one to two weeks; conceivably many infected individuals were not getting a
chance for testing and some of them must have died without being identified as COVIDe19. I'd
say that this kind of under-reporting is unavoidable, especially in the epicenter of a new
pandemic. Actually I suspect that such under-reporting could have happened in this country as
well although perhaps to a lesser degree.

a Third, there could be a third category of casualties, that is, patients who were suffering from
chronic diseases but couldn’t get necessary treatments because hospitals were oven/vhelmed.

i read a sad story in social media in which a patient who needed frequent dialysis committed
suicide by jumping out of his window It is highly likely that many such patients died during the
lockdown even though Icouldn't conﬁrm the specific case or find any statistics. There could be
many other collateral damages including soda-psychological effects.
Combined, the effect of the maximum lockdown, the under-reporting of COVlD—lS cases and COViD-19
deaths as well as collateral deaths of other causes that were associated With the lockdown could be
several times ofthe reported statistics from China. Here l'd not say that China purposely under-
reported COVlD-19 cases or deaths but rather, China pursued an extreme approach and achieved an
extreme result, including severe collateral damages. Of note, Dr. Ll Wenliang (the whistleblowerl voiced
concern on 12/30/2019 and was criticized for having not followed the legally proper reporting process
but nevertheless the WHO China Office was informed on 12/31/2019 of a pneumonia of unknown
cause. detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China
(https: www.who.int/emergencies diseases novelecoronavirus—2019 events-as-the -hapDen).

We in the US and many other countries pursued different approaches, which are more humane but less
effective in terms of blocking tra nsmissions. This is the reality, which needs to be communicated with
and recognized by the public: to make the humane approaches work as effectively as possible, we need
everyone’s support and cooperation, which cannot be achieved by blaming China orWHO. The public
has to understand that we are in a pandemic. which means that tens of millions are supposed to be
infected and millions are supposed to die from it, unless we take necessary actions to block the
llarlslnission and to take good care of the infected.

Finally, l'd like to say a few wordsfor public health colleagues in China. In my personal view, to be fair,
they have done their best to inform the global public health community of the C0V|D719 outbreak in
Wuhan, China by briefing WHO and many countries as soon as they identified COVIDV19 (12/31/2019 —
1/3/2020); they shared the genetic sequence of the virus on 1/12/2020: and the number of scientific
and medical publications in English shortly afterwards was unprecedented. I did a brief search and
identified the following:

Press Conference

NIH Production to ICAN_002208

Former Vice President
Joe Biden
April 1, 2020

(Official Transcript)

amen: Good morning everyone. 1 am glad to see all you reporters sitting 5 feet from each other. 1
know It IS burdensome, out we must work together to defeat this awful lika. . . Keoola. . .the ﬂu . . .

er, what?, . . Imean, you know, the Coroner virus.

Speaking of the current Virus crisis . . . boy that has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it. . it almost rhymes

 

. . .1 would iike to announce my pick of a running mate; Dr Anthor‘y Fauci, Director of the Nationai

ln<titure nf Allergy and lnfertiolis Disease nf NiH since 1924, almost twenty, . er, , many years

ago.

 

Now before I start to answer your questions, let me give you some reasons for my choice.
Number 1: Dr. Fauci is smarter than 1am, but I am taller and younger than he is.

Number 2: He is very experienced. He has worked wiﬂ'l many Presidential administrations since he

came to Washington . . in the 1980’s as I remember He tolo Ronald Reagan about the AIDS

 

epidemic] advised two Bushs . . . one of them gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom . . . by the
way, Ben Carson get his. medal during that same eeremuny, . . . where was 1? 0h, yell t . .twu
Clintons . . . yes two, remember Hilary’s Health Care Plan?. . . and, of course, Obama or two.

Number 3: He gives very good TV interviews, even on Fox News with Sean Hannity trying to mislead

the viewers

NIH Production to ICAN_002209

Number 4: His medical training has given him that special skill that all physicians must have to
succeed — “Always sound right, and if you don’t know an answer, make one up.” But he is like me
or my famous namesaKes on Dragnet. . . Sergeant Joe Friday . I ."Just the facts, Ma'am.”

Now I’ll take your questions.
[Sounds of shouting, general loud babbling, a baby crying, a chair falls over]
REPORTER: “ Mr. Biden have you moved away from your promise to pick a female running mate?"

BIDEN: Die 1 say that? When was that? . . Oh, it was during one of those debates? . . . I wouldn‘t

 

call it a promise. It was a statement from which I am now socially distancing myself, and that makes
it a very timely question. . . .This social distancing is for the pits. I haven’t smelled a good head of
halrin weeks. . . for the record, my test was negative. . . and I will ensure that women’s voices will
be heard in my administration by appointing several to my cabinet. Elizabeth Warren naturally will be

Secretary of the Treasury. Kamala Harris as an experienced prosecutor would be an excellent head of

the Department of Justice . . . I think she is Latino too, isn’t she?. . . I am not sure about Senator
Amy Kolbuchuck from Minnesota and she has great hair, but Marianne Williamson, . . . remember,
the physic healer. . . could serve as Chief of the Alternate Universe . . .excuse me, Alternate

Therapies within HHS. Adding Senator Gillibrand to the cabinet would weigh the group too 'ieavily
towards New York, since Dr. Fauci is from Brooklyn. IWill, of course, appoint Tulsi Gabbard as
Ambassador to America Samoa.

REPORTER: ”Do you have any concerns about any regrettable moments In Dr. Fauci's past?”

EIDEN: Not really. My staff has vetted him very thoroughly. The only whiff of scandal we found was
his medical school yearbook picture where he was being lifted by two of his taller classmates so as to

appear as even taller than they. None of them were in black face.

 

Also. some people may have difficulty knowing htiw

to pronounce his name correctly. It is pronounced as ‘Fow-chi” with the soft c sound common to

NIH Production to ICAN_002210

many Italian names, . . . and as the Senator from Nevada I wish to say that I have many Italian-
American friends who are hard-working, decent citizens, but I must excuse myself from this Corleone
hearing for another Important committee meeting . . .oh, sorry . . . wasI channeling the Godfather

again?. . . a great movie.

There is another small concern, since he is from New Vork City and his name ends in a vowel people
may think he is associated with Rudy Giuliani. . . . but we know that he is taller than Mike.

We have completely debunked the WW that Dr. Fauci has recommended
internal alcohol to kill the coruiiavirus since exLernal alcohol really doesn't work. In fact, he only
recommended it as an antidote to the daily briefings of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr.
Fauci also noted that internal alcohol effects may be briefer than the briefings, so viewers may repeat

a dose PRN (as necessary).

REPORTER: “ Is it true that as noted in your background Press Release just handed out that Dr. Fauci
was born on Christmas Eve, and are you concerned about any back lash from Trump supporters who

regard Trump as the Second Coming.”

BIDEN: Dr. Fauci is an American. Even though he was born in Brooklyn, there is no question about his
citizenship eligibility for this ofﬁce. I think that a resurgence of the Birther Movement which was so
viscously directed at my close friend and mentor, Barrack Obama, . , , there i finally got his name out

there. . . would be very unfortunate. Next question.

REPORTER: “Has Dr, FauCI made any significant contributions In fields other than Virology and
infectious diseases.”

amen: Well let me tell you a downrto earth, fascinating story of one of his most signiﬁcant

Hi Dr. Fauci,
i thought I would reach out to you amidst this crisis; i respect the work you're doing a great deal.
-Hani EI-Gabalawy, did a research sabbatical at NIH

Amazing work that you‘re doing. I’ve been following your discussions and scientific innovation regarding
COVID-19. I’ve been working for the federal government in Inteiligence for about thirteen years and
recently moved to the Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network Secretariat to support the Emergency
Operations Centre at the National Microbiology Lab. I've been with the NML for almost my whole
career.

Just a quick hello and deep respect for your work. My colleagues and Director have said that we're on
the exact same page as you, in terms of your perspective and assessment of the pandemic. Although
there is a border between us, know that we are in agreement with your work and I’m thrilled to see you
advising the public. There is no better person to do the job.

Subject: What can be done?

Why can’t the CDC make a public service announcement that everyone should be wearing
some kind of mask @ in public? It doesn't have to be N95 or even surgical though that
would be ideal [as is done in every Asian country) given that the virus is actually
aerosolized (several studies coniirm this] and that it can be spread by asymptomatic
carriers (which account for poss bly more than half of the positive cases - we will never
know) it seems obvious that food markets are no different from hospitals and in many
cases worse since at least In hospitals people are wearing some protective equipment.
just say wear a cotton mask, a scarf. 3 bandanna, a DP! paper towel rnask.. whatever- but
no one should be going to a market without one and absolutely no one working in a store
or stocking supplies or delivering food, packages, mail etc should be allowed to work
without something covering the face— this includes pharmacists as well, obviously El wtfis
wrong with this country?

What use are gloves? When the offending particles are escaping our faces and floating
around for several hours, landing on everything around us... the only place it shouldn’t be
as critical is outdoors in the sunshine where UV light should deactivate viruses iairly
quickly...

Hope you are all well - and can give me some hope that this message get through the thick
skulls of the so called experts,” even during the 1918 flu epidemic, everyone wore some

facial covering when out in public places - what is going on?

Hi To ni,

You continue to be “the role model” for leaders in
biomedical research these many decades. lam so
proud of your efforts during these remarkable times in
history. Thank youll! I cherish those 5 years (1995-
2000) that I served as Director of NIDR (that became
NIDCR) when we were able to co—sponsor efforts to
utilize saliva as an informative fluid for HIV detection.
For me that was an invaluable opportunity to be part of

NIH Production to ICAN_002225

Harold Varmus’ leadership team and to continue my
research within NIAMS.

I was inspired by your public comments a few nights
ago on CNN regarding your observations of significant
variance in the pathogenesis or phenotypes noted for
subsets of critically ill patients with COVlD-19 on
ventilators in ICU. l was immediately reminded of David
Feinberg (CEO of UCLA Health Sciences, more recently
5 years at Geisingers, and currently CEO of Google
Health Companies) who used genotyping for
populations around Lancaster PA and discovered about
3-4% with undiagnosed genetic diseases that translated
into reduced costs of hospitalization, treatments, etc.
Kaiser-Permanente Northern California, and many
other systems, have also used this approach since
sequencing has become cost effective. Perhaps a select
sample of people who require ICU, and another that
require ventilator, might inform the genotype of the
most susceptible people and might also inform a target
to use to discover what existing drug or therapy could
be mobilized. Through your position, might there
already be a large data set of whole genome sequences
(e.g. military) that could be rapidly explored using
bioinformatics?

As you may recall, my personal research activities have
focused on craniofacial diseases and disorders. For
example, Osteogenesis Imperfects (O.I.) presents
cardiopulmonary disorders in addition to bone and

NIH Production to ICAN_002226

tooth disorders. Since penetrance varies, cases of rare
conditions can illuminate ”hidden" SNP abnormalities
in key gene clusters (e.g. MHC gene clusters, etc.).
Considering lung disorders as you mentioned in your
comments about pathogenesis, already known gene
mutations that present several major phenotypes
including pulmonary diseases could become very
useful. Perhaps Francis and others at the NIH could
create a trans-NIH approach that is enabled to visit this
pandemic from the perspective of human phenotype
variance discovered via genomics?

| asked Martha Somerman to explore the talents
available at NIDCR (and beyond) related to connective
tissue genetic diseases that associate with Types 1 and
111 collagens, elastics, and hyaluronic acid
glycoproteins AND lung tissue fibrosis, etc. She may
also reach out to you.

Meanwhile, thank you for your untiring efforts to use
science to inform health policy. Of course, let me know
ifl can be of any use to you.

Always, Hal

I am so sorry that l took so long to get back to you. I receive over 1000 e-mails per day and
even with staff screening. I do not see them for days. There is still an issue/problem with
serologic tests in that they need to be validated as being sensitive and specific. Many tests that
have been used thus far are not accurate and ARE MlSLEADING. The UK bought millions of
these from China and found that they were inadequate. The FDA is in the process of validating
certain tests this week and if they pass, then we can expect to have tests within the next few
weeks to do the things that you have suggested.

Dear Dr Fauci,

I hope this email finds you well.

Thank you for everything you are doing for our country in these difficult times.

l realize your time is extremely valuable , especially duringthese times.

I have one question - if you can help me answering it.

Why are serologic tests not made abundantly available during these times?

This will help in so many ways:

, Can it be used to triage healthcare workers? Naturally "vaccinated" healthcare workers may be better

triaged to be on the front lines for example, taking care of COVlD-19 patients. (In times of limited PPE,
documentation of natural immunity is probably one of the best PPE's out there)

NIH Production to ICAN_002229

-Another major use for it:

People can be asked to remain home, until they have documentation of natural immunization.
Serologic tests are very cheap. can be mailed, and done at home.

immunized individuals can carry the test as "proof" of immunity - and may be able to go back to work
etc.

It is just a thought. it may be a very candid question that I am asking.

But while we are waiting for a vaccine land this will take several months), some people may be able to
benefit from a very cheap test (that can be done at home) to short-circuit that waiting time.

Thank you for everything you are doing to our country.

You are such an inpiration to Us all.

I wish you all the best.

Thank you.

lam writing today to see if you would allow us to make a film on your life and
career. We would require very little of your precious time right now, perhaps one
or two very briefvidecrlink phone interviews over the next few months, just as you
have appeared on Trevor Noah's The Dally Show and spoken with basketball star
Steph Curry. Later this year, after the current crisis has subsided, we would find
time in your busy schedule for a proper sit-down in which you could tell us the
stories that speak to the key moments in your remarkable career.

I am excited to work with Lia Carney and Topspin Productions on this project,
because it has been important to me to expand the roster of AMERICAN MASTERS
films to include scientists. Over its 33 year history, our series has profiled artists
such as Leonard Bernstein, Maya Angelou and Raul Julia, athletes including Billie
Jean King and Ted Williams, and now we are presenting the stories oflames
Watson and Oliver Sacks in our pantheon of great films. Our series is dedicated to
telling biographies with the utmost care, and for that reason we have been
honored with awards like the Emmy, the Peabody, the Grammy and even an
Oscar,

We would be honored to have you join us in our public television effort to educate
Americans about the domestic and global health issues that have been the focus of
your career. This letter is brief because we respect your time, but we sincerely

Going through yourexcellent chapter, [Chapter 197) in page 1445, on AIDS and related disorders in
HPIM-ZO. under secondary prophylaxis/ maintenance therapy for Toxoplasmosis it is said that "it may
be discontinued in the setting of effective cARl’ and increases in CD4+ T cell counts to > 200/
microliter for 6 months".

In page 1615, another wonderfully written chapter, 1 Chapter 223 ) on Toxoplasma infections. Professor
Kami Kim has mentioned that " individuals who have completed initial therapy for TE should receive
treatment indefinitely unless immune reconstitution with a CD4 & T cell cont of >200 occurs as a
consequence of cART".

Since both feature in the same textbook followed worldwide by medicos, could you please clarify the
above?

I stand subject to any corrections

Hoping that we fight Camel-19 effectively very soon. Stay safe.

Hello Dr. Fauci,
I hope you are staying well in these trying times.

NIH Production to ICAN_002240

I'm writing to request a chance to embed with a team doing a coronavirus serosurvey, to tell a
public health story from the front lines as I believe I'm uniquely positioned to do. I've made a
similar request to the CDC, but the nationwide reach of the NlAID serosurvey might make my
proposal easierto consider, so I'm coming hat in hand to you as well.

Twenty years ago, as a temporary CDC employee during a four-month Knight Journalism
fellowship. I had the opportunity to take the EIS course in Atlanta and then work on several CDC
outbreak and disease investigations One was a serosurvey on Long Island after West Nile virus
had recently emerged in the US.

I headed one ofa dozen CDC teamsthat included a driver, a phlebotomist and a health aide
from the New Vork state and Suffolk County health departments. We went door-to-door to
consent participants. get blood samples and do interviews on exposure and symptoms.

I appreciate the tremendous scientificvalue that serosurveys offer and the kind of attention to
detail and study rigor that‘s needed to get reliable information. I'm also a longtime medlcal
journalist who understands and is sensitive to confidentiality, ethical and privacy concerns. I've
been recognized by my peers as a science writing leader.

https: [casw org casw article mariiynnemarchionerassociatedrpressrwrnsevictorecohnrprize

I've attached some letters from CDC and other health officials regarding my work on the
serosurvey, a photo of the EIS and CDC team (that's me toward the right in the front row) and
the MMWR report resulting from our work The field supervisor -- Dr. Anthony Marlin, now
with the global vaccine group PATH ( “E is willingto speak to you on my
behalf. Dr. Richard Besser, now president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was my
fellowship supervisor and mentor at CDC. Others I worked with include Dr. Anne Schuchat, Dr.
John Ward, Dr. Robert Tauxe and Dr. Lyle Petersen.

And of course, you know me from nearly three decades of medical writing, including the
HIV/AIDS government trip to Africa when Tommy Thompson was healthy secretary.

The Associated Press reaches half of the world's population every day. I hope to offer a story
that l and the AP are uniquely able to provide, to show and explain how public health is done
and how science is accomplished during a pandemic. Thank you for considering my request.

Dear Dr. Fauci:

I write simply to thank you and congratulate you for your incredible efforts during the management of
this pandemic as it reaches across our nation, The unique challenges that this pandemic has
created have also created opportunities, and we here at the University of Nebraska Medical Center
have proudly participated with our federal, state and local partners during this COVID-19 pandemic
as well as over the last 16 years, having matured an extensive program in the research, education,
and clinical components of highly infectious diseases and biocontainment.

The UNMC Center for Global Health Security has been the umbrella organization that has organized
all of these components and continues to have strong leadership from retired military public health
as well as gifted research scientists lrorn across the nation. As a co-founding partner of NETEC, as
a recipient of the Regional Disaster Health Service Awards, and as a close collaborator with the
Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, the Department of
Homeland Security and the Department of State, we have enjoyed the opportunity to always "lean
in" as the need arises.

I am sure your days are full not only of the complex logistics and tension that ﬁll leadership roles at
this time but also maintaining a "steady hand on the rudder" as we navigate these challenging

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for highlighting the health
disparities and disproportionate burden of disease influencing outcome
of Covid-19 infections in African Americans, Participants in my
observational, longitudinal, epidemiologic Baltimore-based study,
HANDLS httgszﬂhandls mh 3ch are terrified by the level of disease they are
seeing in their communities across Baltimore. We have been on the
phone with and texting participants to educate them, support them in
their efforts to get tested, remind them ofthe importance of social
distancing and self-isolation when appropriate to protect their

health. We are acutely aware of their fragility. Testing in Baltimore is
limited. The National Guard has set up community testing at the
Pimlico Race Track; however, although we have deployed our mobile
medical research vehicles to Pimlico in the past to conduct our study,
the current crime rate is such that our participants and community
residents in general do not go to the Pimlico area especially ifthey are
on foot. The other issue with testing for African Americans and our
participants is the need to have a health care provider that one can
contract to discuss symptoms to get a referral for testing. The
unravelling of the Affordable Care Act has severely impacted access for
African Americans across the nation and especially in Baltimore. Our
participants are calling my staff clinician and nurse practitioner for
referrals if they have symptoms. We have reached out to colleagues at

NIH Production to ICAN_002261

Health Care for the Homeless. JHU and other medical entities to
facilitate access.

Thank you all you are doing. Since I work in Baltimore, I haven't seen

you in person since—
—. The current pandemic however, reminds me
of the days of the AIDS epidemic when I worked as Sam Broder's
special assistant for underserved populations while Peggy Hamburg
worked for you. l was in awe of you and Sam then and I remain in awe
of you today. l have known many Regis men...but you are clearly head
and shoulders above them all.

Dear Tony and Patty:

Responses to Burklow‘s questions to me from your group call yesterday:

1) I think we have landed in the right place for the ﬁlm about your life. Nat Geo,
Disney, and Bob Iger himself. all understand the need for discretion now but are
wildly supportive about releasing a ﬁlm that will celebrate the importance of your
life. science and public health. I wanted the best home, broadest distribution, and
strongest team for your ﬁlm. You have entrusted me with your story, so [just want
to do right by it. We are really happy with the ﬁlming that we have done so for
personal MW home, school) to work (ofﬁce etc).

3) The other ﬁlm we have been working on (ENDING AIDS), which follows
globally the HVTN trials/latest Aids research to complete “the toolbox” is deﬁnitely
still happening It is now in pause with COVID-l 9r . “but will move forward again
when we get through this, Filming at research sites in South Africa US. and Latin
America has been great...and when you have tirnei in the ﬁiture I will outline.
You obviously are a key subject in ENDING AIDS also, but ENDING AIDS will
spend a lot of time with doctors at the ﬁeld research sites and with volunteers in the
trials. The Aids conference and meetings footage we have shot with you will he
shared between ﬁlms, smartly and distinctly, ENDING AIDS will be released a
year plus later than the release of your biographical tilmgl am focused on your film
now. Howard Hughes Medical Institute remains the educational partner on ENDING
AIDS. In the fall we will ﬁnalize the broadcast/streaming partner for ENDING
AIDS. So, bottom line it will be released a year after your ﬁlm, and will be a ﬁlm
focused on showing in detail where we are now with aids research and the key
people in the chain from you to a young female volunteer in South Africa’a young
male volunteer in Birmingham,

FILMING REQUESTS for your ﬁlm now.

4) NO more asking to ﬁlm With the Task Force.

5) I do have two personal ﬁlming requests for you — would it be possible to drive to
NIH with you once or twice a week and capture your working/appropriate
conversations in the car. That will he so helpful narratively to tracking your
scientiﬁc and communication leadership. The footage we did that ﬁrst day is truly

 

NIH Production to ICAN_002263

great. We will just tum around and come back after the ride there--- in our follow
car (we have NIH access badges). Secondly. would it be possible to sit down with
you on camera for 15 minutes once a week (on the weekend?) at the ofﬁce or on the
back deck/some safe location to talk with me in real time about what you are
managing with treatments, vaccines, etc. so we can pull the
soientiﬁcr’communication narrative on COVID-l9 through your ﬁlm.

6) We love the live truck and the walks, so whenever that works we will be there.
7) I NEVER ever want to interfere with the work on the Task Force, lives are at
stake. IF something doesn’t work for ﬁlming no questions asked we don’t do it, we
stop. cancel/pivot. No need to explain. the team here understands and only wants to
do what works for you. your team. . .. “a.

With appreciation,

Janet

Dr. Fauei 7

Almost embarrassed to ask. but would you be willing/able to speak virtually to the
American Broncho-Esophagological Association (dbeunel) on Friday April 24”“?

This year marks the 100m anniversary of this venerable organization that brings
together clinicians (mainly Otolaryngologists) who care for patients with complex
upper aerodigestive tract disorders. Our annual National Meeting has been cancelled
and we are hosting a Virtual meeting it it’s stead.

As Otolaryngologists, we are currently and expect to continue to be dramatically
impacted by the current pandemic, given that our care for patients routinely includes
upper airway endoscopy (30-40 scope procedures a day is routine) which as you
know is a high-risk aerosohzing procedure. As I'm sure you are aware.
Otolaryngolgists have been amongst the hardest hit clinicians in terms ofpatienHo-
provider transmission ofCOVlD-IQ.

Your input for 1015 minutes would be an honor, Discussion topics could include
general comments about the pandemic, a sense of what to expect in the coming
months and years. and what we can do as medical leaders to prepare/or these
changes in the US and abroad.

If this is something you are interested in, with whom on your communications team
could I communicate?

Thanks so much for the consideration 7 your brief presence and input would mean a
great deal to our society.

I hope that you are dolng well despite all that you are dealing with around COVID-19. It has been many
years since I had the opportunity to work with you but myjob at NIAID was one of my favorite positions
and gave me a great start to my career. 50, when l saw the below graphic, It made me smile and l
wanted to send you a note.

I truly appreciate how you are handling the COVID-19 situation. Vour comments are a breath of fresh air
amidst politics and uncertainty. With daily White House press brieﬁngs, increased security and scrutiny,
24/7 media interviews and great popularity, you seem to be holding up well - as you always do. Your
recent interview with )AMA’s Editor-in-Chief Howard Bauchner was particularly well done and very
enlightening.

A majority of a small group of patients showed Improvements after being treated with an experimental
coronavirus treatment made by Gilead Sciences, bolstering hopes for finding a treatment for the
disease, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine Friday.

The group of patients received the anti-viral drug remdesivir as part of a "compassionate use" trial, not a
doublevblind placebocontrolled trial which would offer more definitive evidence Also, the cohort of
patients was small, only 53 patients in the United States and around the world These limiting factors
prevent scientists from declaring that the drug works.

Still, the improvements offered positive news about a drug seen by global health authorities as offering
the best shot at becoming a treatment for the disease.

Thirty six patients out oi 53 — or two-thirds — showed improvement in oxygen support, trial authors
said. Seventeen of 30 patients who were on ventilators were able to be taken off the |ife~suppor1
machines.

“We cannot draw deﬁnitive conclusions from these data, but the observations from this group of
hospitalized patients who received remdesivir are hopeful,” saidlonathan D. Grein, MD, Director of
Hospital Epidemiology, Cedars‘Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, and lead author of the journal article.
“We look forward to the results of controlled clinical trials to potentially validate these findings.“

While 68 percent of the patients showed improvement in the level of oxygen support they needed, 13
percent died, the NEJM study said. That 13 percent compares favorably to mortality rates of 17 to 78
percent in China among severely ill patients, the authors wrote.

NIH Production to ICAN_002283

Gilead’s stock has been bolstered for weeks by expectations over remdesiVir.

Remdesivir was discovered by Gilead in the hunt for antiviral drugs about a decade ago, and the
National Institutes of Health has partnered with the company to explore its benefits. It was shown to
work against an array of viruses in laboratory tests.

It showed effectiveness in primates infected with Ebola but failed in a trial in the Democratic Republican
of Congo in humans with the deadly disease It has shown effectiveness as a preventive therapy in
primates for MERS, which is a coronavirus cousin of the CovidJS virus.

There are no treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat coronavirus, but the
FDA has granted an emergency use authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine,
two decades—old anti-malarial drugs. There is scant evidence that the therapy works, but President
Trump has repeatedly boosted the promise oi the drugs

Even while multiple full clinical trials of rerndesivir continue, Gilead hasbeen swamped with reguests for
"compassionate use” ofthe drug. Undercornpassionate use rules, physicians can obtain experimental
drugs for their seriously ill patients when there is nothing else to try.

Gilead sald last week that It had enough ofthe experimental drug on hand to treat up to 140,000 people
under compassionate use programs.

How Anthony Fauci Became
America’s Doctor

An infectious—disease expert ’5 long crusade against some of
humanity ’s most virulent threats.

"You stay completely apolitical and non-ideological, ” Fauci says. “I 'm a scientist
and I‘m aphysician. Andi/1111‘s it. "Htustramn by Tyler Comne Pholograuh 3y Wm McNamee / Getty

Just before midnight on March 22nd, the President of the United States
prepared to tweet. Millions of Americans, in the hope of safeguarding
their health and ﬁghting the rapidly escalating spread of COVID—l9, had
already begun to follow the sober recommendation of Anthony S. Fauci,
the country’s leading expert on infectious disease Fauci had warned
Americans to “hunker down signiﬁcantly more than we as a country are
doing.” Donald Trump disagreed. “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE
THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” he tweeted.

Trump had seen enough of “social distancing.” In an election year, he
was watching the stock market collapse, unemployment spike, and the
national mood devolve into collective anxiety. “I would love to have the
country opened up, and just rarin’ to go by Easter,” he said, on Fox
News. “You’ll have packed churches all over our country. I think it’ll be
a beautiful time.”

Trump’s Easter forecast came more than two months after the ﬁrst US.
case of COVlD—l9 was identiﬁed, in Washington State, and more than a
hundred days after the novel coronavirus emerged, ﬁrst from bats and
then from a live—animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Every day,
more people were falling sick and dying. Despite a catastrophic lack of

NIH Production to ICAN_002286

testing capacity, it was clear that the Virus had reached every comer of
the nation. With the Easter holiday just a few weeks away, there was not
a single public-health ofﬁcial in the United States who appeared to share
the President’s rosy surmises.

Anthony F auci certainly did not. At seventy—nine, Fauci has run the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for thirty-six years,
through six Administrations and a long procession of Viral epidemics:
H.I.V., SARS, avian inﬂuenza, swine flu, Zika, and Ebola among them.
As a member of the Administration’s coronavirus task force, Fauci
seemed to believe that the government’s actions could be directed, even
if the President’s pronouncements could not. At White House brieﬁngs,
it has regularly fallen to Fauci to gently amend Trump’s absurdities,
half-truths, and outright lies. No, there is no evidence that the malaria
drug hydroxychloroquine will provide a “miracle” treatment to stave off
the infection. No, there won’t be a vaccine for at least a year. When the
President insisted for many weeks on denying the government’s inability
to deliver test kits for the virus, Fauci, testifying before Congress, put
the matter bluntly. “That’s a failing,” he said. “Let’s admit it.”

\Vhen Trump was not dismissing the severity of the crisis, he was
blaming others for it: the Chinese, the Europeans, and, as always, Barack
Obama. He blamed governors who were desperate for federal help and
had been reduced to ﬁghting one another for lifesaving ventilators. In
one brieﬁng, Governor Andrew Cuomo, of New York, said, “It’s like
being on eBay with ﬁfty other states, bidding on a ventilator.” Trump
even accused hospital workers in New York City of pilfering surgical
masks and other vital protective equipment that they needed to stay
alive. “Are they going out the back door?" Trump wondered aloud.

As a reporter who writes mainly on science and public-health issues,
I’ve known Fauci since the H.I.V./A1DS epidemic exploded, in the mid—
eighties. He once explained to me that he has developed a method for
dealing with political leaders in times of crisis: “I go to my favorite book
of philosophy, ‘The Godfather,’ and say, ‘It’s nothing personal, it’s
strictly business.’ ” He continued, “You just have a job to do. Even
when somebody’s acting ridiculous, you can’t chide them for it. You’ve

NIH Production to ICAN_002287

got to deal with them, Because if you don’t deal with them, then you’re
out of the picture.”

Since his days of advising Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush,
Fauci has maintained a simple credo: “You stay completely apolitical
and non-ideological, and you stick to what it is that you do. I’m a
scientist and I’m a physician. And that’s it.” He learned the value of
candor early. “Some wise person who used to be in the White House, in
the Nixon Administration, told me a very interesting dictum to live by,”
he told me in 2016, during a public conversation we had at the ﬁfty-year
reunion of his medical-school class. “He said, ‘When you go into the
White House, you should be prepared that that is the last time you will
ever go in. Because if you go in saying, I’m going to tell somebody
something they want to hear, then you’ve shot yourself in the foot.’ Now
everybody knows I‘m going to tell them exactly what’s the truth.”
Americans have come to rely on Fauci’s authoritative presence. Perhaps
not since the Vietnam era, when Walter Cronkite, the avuncular anchor
of the “CBS Evening News,” was routinely described as the most trusted
man in America, has the country depended so completely on one person
to deliver a daily dose of plain talk. In one national poll, released last
Thursday, seventy—eight per cent of participants approved of F auci’s
performance. Only scvcn per cent disapproved.

On March 23rd, Fauci failed to appear at the daily brieﬁng in the White
House pressroom. Twitter promptly lost its mind. #NoFauci became a
top trending topic, followed closely by #whereisFauci and
#letTonyspeak. There was speculation that Trump, who is inclined to
ﬁre anyone who disagrees with him or, worse, garners some praise in the
media, had lost patience with Fauci. As one ofFauci’s old friends told
me, “This is a President who doesn’t give a shit about Fauci’s
accomplishments, his history, or his learning. If anything, they’re
negatives."

The truth was less alarming. “I was tied up in a task-force meeting, and
we were trying to work out some difﬁcult policies,” Fauci said. “I have
no trouble with the President. When I talk to him, he listens.” My
experience with Fauci suggested that this last statement was perhaps a
triumph of pragmatism over accuracy. His priority, as he's made clear, is

NIH Production to ICAN_002288

to do what is necessary to save lives. So I was not surprised to receive an
email from Fauci the following day, saying that he had been asked to
refrain from participating in personal proﬁles. It seemed that it was one
thing for him to talk about the news with reporters or even to chat on
lnstagram with Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors star. But
focussing on himself, rather than on the President, was another thing
entirely.

Fauci and Trump are about as odd a duo as American political life has
ever produced. Both men are in their seventies. Both come from the
outer boroughs of New York City. Both are direct, even blunt. But that’s
where the resemblance ends. Fauci has always been a person of unusual
discipline. Nearing eighty, he works about eighteen hours a day. Long
ago, when his three children were young, he and his wife, Christine
Grady, who runs the bioethics department at the National Institutes of
Health, decided to maintain the sanctity of family dinners by starting
them when he got home from the ofﬁce, at around nine o’clock. For
decades, Fauci has taken long lunchtime runs, but, during the crisis, he’s
cut back his routine to power walkingiand only on weekends. Fauci
parses his words with care and believes, above all, in the power of facts
and the efﬁcacy of data.

David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate and a pioneer of molecular biology,
told me, “Tony is unique, in that he has such credibility with politicians
that he’s been able to insert hard facts into the conversation. That has
been wonderful for our country and the world.” According to David
Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford University who for years has
advised the government on biological threats, “Tony has essentially
become the embodiment of the biomedical and public—health research
enterprise in the United States. Nobody is a more tireless champion of
the truth and the facts. I am not entirely sure what we would do without
him.”

Fauci can be impatient with the compromises of politics. In my

conversations with him, he has responded furiously when a dicey
amendment, a bogus rider, or a “poison pill” is attached to a public-

NIH Production to ICAN_002289

health bill. He recalled one congressional provision, in 2016, that tried to
make it “legally permissible to fly the Confederate ﬂag at national
cemeteries. I am not kidding.” When dealing with politicians, he told
me, he relies on the pseudo—Latin expression Illegitimi non
carborundum: Don’t let the bastards grind you down. But he has
inspired respect throughout the political world and beyond. Fauci’s
ofﬁce walls are covered with scores of photographs of him with
Presidents, senators, visiting Prime Ministers, business leaders, actors. In
October, 1988, George H. W. Bush, during a Presidential debate with
Michael Dukakis, was asked who his heroes were. “I think of Dr.
Fauci,” Bush replied. “You’ve probably never heard of him. . . . He’s a
very fine researcher, a top doctor at the National Institutes of Health,
working hard, doing something about research on this disease of AIDS.”
These days, nearly everyone has heard of Fauci. Pandemic—memorabilia
entrepreneurs have put his face on bottle openers, coffee mugs, and
bumper stickers: “In Dr. Fauci we trust.” The National Bobblehead Hall
of Fame and Museum has produced a seveniinch likeness ofhim, partly
to raise money to produce protective gear for medical workers. There’s a
F acebook group called Dr. Fauci Speaks, We Listen, and another called
Dr. F auci Memes for Social Distance Teens. A petition has circulated to
nominate him as People ’5 “scxicst man alive.”

On right-wing social media and talk radio. Fauci has a different image:
he is routinely disparaged as a closet lefty who is exaggerating the threat
of the coronavirus. “Has anyone else noticed that every suggestion by
Dr. Doom Faucijust happens to also be the worst possible thing for the
economy?” the conservative Internet TV host Bill Mitchell tweeted.
“That’s not an accident folks." An analysis in the Times found more than
seventy Twitter accounts that have pushed the hashtag #FauciFraud,
with some tweeting out anti—Fauci bile hundreds of times a day. “There
seems to be a concerted effort on the part of Trump supporters to spread
misinformation about the virus,” Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology
at the University of Washington who has studied misinformation, told
the paper. “There is this sense that experts are untrustworthy, and have
agendas that aren’t aligned with the people.” Fauci has received so many
personal threats that the Justice Department recently approved a security

NIH Production to ICAN_002290

detail for him. Fauci shrugged it off, telling reporters, “I’ve chosen this
life.”

The crisis that the world now faces comes as no surprise to Fauci. On
January 10, 2017, ten days before Trump took the oath of ofﬁce, Fauci
delivered the keynote address at a conference at Georgetown University,
titled “Pandemic Preparedness for the Next Administration.” After
describing his years of managing epidemics, he posed a series of
questions to the audience: “Will there be a resurgence of Zika? We’re
getting into the summer in South America. Are we going to see a
resurgence or not? What about inﬂuenza? Are we going to get a new
pandemic?”

Fauci’s last point, he emphasized, was almost certainly the most
important: the possibility that some unknown, powerfully infectious
pathogen could emerge to threaten the world. “What about things that
we’re not even thinking about?” he said. He let the question drift out
over the hall. “What is for sure,” he concluded, “is that, no matter what,
history has told us deﬁnitively that it will happen.”

On the day that Anthony Stephen Fauci was born, the front—page
headline in the Times was "PRESlDENT TO GlVE EMERGENCY FACTS TO
NATION ON RADIO.” It was Christmas Evc, 1940. Thc Second World
War had begun, and the United States was less than a year away from
joining the ﬁght.

Fauci grew up in southwest Brooklyn, ﬁrst in Bensonhurst and later in
Dyker Heights, where his family ran a pharmacy and lived in an
apartment upstairs. The pharmacy was across the street from the Shrine
Church of St. Bernadette. When Mass was ﬁnished on Sundays, Fauci
recalled, people would walk over to get prescriptions ﬁlled and to buy
whatever else they needed for the coming week. Tony’s father, Stephen,
dispensed medications, and was known to customers as Doc. His
mother, Eugenia, worked the register, along with his older sister, Denise.
From an early age, Tony spent evenings and weekends riding around the
neighborhood on his Schwinn, making deliveries.

F auci’s parents were born in New York; one set of grandparents had
emigrated from Naples, the other from Sicily. Anthony ﬁrst took
Communion at the age of seven and was conﬁrmed at twelve. He went
to elementary school at Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Bensonhurst. “I had
no idea at the time when I was there, being taught by the Dominican
nuns, thatI would be interested in science,” he said “I was interested in
a lot of things, mostly spons, but certainly not science.”

In those days, baseball was the social glue of Brooklyn. The borough
was Dodger territory and Ebbets Field was consecrated ground—but

F auci was devoted to the Yankees, who played in the faraway Bronx. In
the midst of the coronavirus crisis, I e-mailed to ask about this anomaly,
not necessarily expecting an answer. He replied almost instantly. “You
probably are unaware, but half the kids in Brooklyn were Yankee fans,”
he wrote. “We spent our days arguing who was better: Duke Snider
versus Mickey Mantle; Roy Campanella versus Yogi Berra; Pee Wee
Reese versus Phil Rizzuto and on and on. Those were the days, my
friend.”

Fauci has often referred to his father as “laid—back,” which, if true, must
be a characteristic that skips a generation. “Tony has always been
driven,” Michael Osterholm, the director ofthe University of
Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Discasc Rcscarch and Policy, and a
longtime friend of Fauci’s, told me. “Whatever he was doing, he had to
do it better than anybody else. I don’t know if it was certainty or
something else. But he was meant to lead. Always. Everyone who knew
him knew that. And Tony knew it, too.”

In 1954, he began attending Regis, a private Jesuit high school on the
Upper East Side. Rigorous, small, competitive, and tuition-free, Regis is
considered one of the ﬁnest all-male schools in the country. F auci
thrived there, though the commute between Dyker Heights and Eighty—
fourth and Madison was long. He once estimated that he had spent the
equivalent of seventy days of his teen-age life on the various subways
and buses he took to get to and from school.

Fauci revelled in the demanding coursework. “We took four years of
Greek, four years of Latin, three years of French, ancient history,
theology," he recalled. He developed an ability to set out an argument

NIH Production to ICAN_002292

and to bolster it with evidence—good preparation, it turned out, for
testifying before Congress. Last year, at a dinner that Regis held in his
honor, he said that the school had taught him "to communicate scientiﬁc
principles, or principles of basic and clinical research, without getting
very profuse and off on tangents.”

At the time, though, Fauci had no interest in becoming a doctor. “I was
captain of the Regis High School basketball team.” he once told me. “I
thought this was what I wanted to do with myself. But, being a realist, I
very quickly found out that a ﬁve-seven, really fast, good-shooting point
guard will never be as good as a really fast, good-shooting seven-footer.
I decided to change the direction of my career”

At school, Fauci’s accomplished peers were headed to careers in
medicine, engineering, and the law. At home, he was steeped in the
humanities: “Virtually all my relatives on my mother’s sideiher father,
her brother, and her sister’s childreniare artists.” His mother helped tip
the balance. “She never really pressured me in any way, but I think I
subtly picked up the vibrations that she wanted very much for me to be a
physician,” Fauci said. “There was this tensioniwould it be humanities
and classics, or would it be science? As I analyzed that, it seemed to me
that being a physician was the perfect melding of both of those
aspirations.”

From Regis, Fauci went on to another Jesuit institution, Holy Cross, in
Worcester, Massachusetts. His high—school faculty had left him little
choice in the matter. “They just wouldn’t write a recommendation for
you if you wanted to apply to Harvard or to Cornell, or Columbia,” he
said. Fauci enrolled in 1958 and was pleased to ﬁnd that the university
took a broad view of premedical studies. He signed up for a program
called Bachelor of Arts—Greek Classics—Premed. “It was really kind of
bizarre," he recalled. “We did a lot of classics, Greek, Latin, Romance
languages. . . . We took many credits of philosophy, everything from
epistemology to philosophical psychology, logic, etc. But we took
enough biology and physics and science to get you into medical
school.”

During the summers, Fauci worked construction jobs. One year, he
found himself assigned to a crew that was building a new library at

NIH Production to ICAN_002293

Cornell Medical College, on the Upper East Side. “On lunch break,
when the crew were eating their hero sandwiches and making catcalls to
nurses, I snuck into the auditorium to take a peek,” Fauci recalled in
1998, at the medical school’s centennial celebration. “I got goosebumps
as I entered, looked around the empty room, and imagined what it would
be like to attend this extraordinary institution. After a few minutes at the
doorway, a guard came and politely told me to leave, since my dirty
boots were soiling the ﬂoor. I looked at him and said proudly that I
would be attending this institution a year from now. He laughed and
said, ‘Right, kid, and next year I am going to be Police

Commissioner.’ ”

Fauci graduated ﬁrst in his class from Cornell in 1966, just as America’s
involvement in Vietnam was accelerating. Every new physician was
required to perform some kind of military service. “We were gathered in
the auditorium at Cornell, early in our fourth year of medical school,”
Fauci recalled. “Unlike today, we had only two women in the class and
seventy-nine men. The recruiter from the armed forces came there and
said, ‘Believe it or not, when you graduate from medical school at the
end of the year, except for the two women, everyone in this room is
going to be either in the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, or the Public
Health Service. So you’re going to have to make your choice. Sign up
and give your preferences.’ ”

Fauci wanted to work in the US. Public Health Service; his fallback was
the Navy. He got his ﬁrst choice, and ended up at the National Institutes
of Health, which was then establishing itself as the country’s primary
center for biomedical research. Nearly everyone in academic medicine
spent some time at one of its branches; except for three years back at
Cornell to complete his internship and residency, Fauci has spent five
decades there.

In 1972, Fauci started as a senior researcher at the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He was drawn to investigating ailments
that were difﬁcult but not impossible to treat. “I Wanted something that
could make you very sick and kill you unless I intervened. And if I

NIH Production to ICAN_002294

intervene, you’re essentially cured,” he told Ushma Neill, the editor

of T he Journal of Clinical Investigation, in 2014. “Now, that seems a
little bit too simplistic, but that’s really the nature of most infectious
diseases.”

Working in the lab of Sheldon Wolff, F auci studied the molecular nature
of fever. The ﬁeld of immunology was still young, but scientists were
rapidly learning how to manipulate the smallest components of
individual cells, which opened the way to a decade of discovery.
Chronic fevers can have a number ofunderlying causes, among them an
uncommon condition known as vasculitis—an inﬂammation of the
blood cells that often occurs when the body’s immune system
mistakenly attacks its own blood vessels. Many of Fauci‘s vasculitis
patients suffered from rare inﬂammatory diseases, such as
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which damages blood vessels in the
lungs, kidneys, and other organs. The disease was almost always fatal.
Fauci and his infectious-disease colleagues at the NIH. were frequently
asked to visit the National Cancer Institute, which was in the same
building as his lab, to consult on patients who were receiving
chemotherapy. The drugs suppressed tumors, but they were highly toxic.
And they had another side effect, F auci told me: “Those people are
susceptible to a lot of things like infections and bleeding, because the
treatment has destroyed their immune systems.”

In 1990, F auci was the government's leading researcher focussed on

the AIDS epidemicpnobgyaph by George Tames/The New Vork Times / Redux

Fauci, together with Wolff, his mentor, wondered if this side effect
could be harnessed to help vaseulitis patients, whose immune systems
were overactive. “I thought if we could somehow give a cancer drug at a
low enough dose perhaps we could turn the disease off without any of
the secondary complications,” he recalled recently. “First we did it in a
few patients, and, much to our delight, they had a total remission. Before
you know it, we ended up curing a very, very lethal, albeit uncommon,
disease.”

For the ﬁrst time, this technique enabled researchers to do effective
work on lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and transplant rejection. “If you
look at immunology, it has from the very beginning been inextricably
linked to infectious diseases,” Fauei said. “What is the immune system
for? The immune system protects you against invaders from withouti
microorganisms—as well as, in some cases, the emergence of certain
tumors from within.”

In 1981, a strange new syndrome emerged that transformed Fauci’s
research and, eventually, the lives of millions of people around the

NIH Production to ICAN_002296

world. “All of a sudden, this new disease comes along,” F auci recalled,
referring to what would soon come to be known as AIDS. “Even before
the cause of it was proven to be H.I.V., everybody in the ﬁeld knew that
it had to be a Virus. I said to myself, ‘Here it is, a virus, still to be
determined, that’s affecting profoundly and destroying the human
immune system.’ ” Fauci believed that he had been training all his life
for a threat like this one. He was an expert in viruses and in the immune
systemiand he had always been attracted to combatting serious, even
fatal diseases. “I wanted to be where the action was,” he said.

At first, few public-health ofﬁcials seemed to care. In June of 1981,

the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a publication of the Centers
for Disease Control, issued a paper that included an account of five
young men, all gay, who had contracted pneumocystis, a form of
pneumonia that had previously been reported only in people with
dramatically impaired immune systems. The young men described in the
study had all been healthy. “I thought it was a ﬂuke,” Fauci recalled. “I
put it aside on my desk, thinking that maybe this was some drug that
they had taken that suppressed their immune system.”

A month later, an even more alarming report arrived from the CDC.

F auci read it with an uneasy sense that a disaster was looming: “1 made
the decision that I was going to stop what I was doing, much to the
chagrin of my mentors, who were saying, ‘VVhy do you want to give up
a great trajectory of a career to study a handful of gay men with this
strange disease?’ But, deep down, I really knew that this was going to
explode.”

Fauci wrote a paper to sound the alarm. “I called it my apologia pro vita
suaian explanation for what I‘m doing,“ he said. In the paper, Fauci
pointed out that, although the disease “seems to selectively affect a
particular segment of our society,” it demanded a medical solution.
Moreover, he warned, “any assumption that the syndrome will remain
restricted to a particular segment of our society is truly an assumption
without a scientific basis.” Fauci sent the manuscript to The New
England Journal of Medicine, in late 1981. It was rejected. “One of the
reviewers said I was being alarmist,” Fauci said. He tried a different

NIH Production to ICAN_002297

journal, T he Annals of Internal Medicine, and the following June the
paper was published.

In the laboratory, Fauci began making progress. He had been
investigating B cells, which are involved in the production of antibodies.
ln 19834before H.l.V. was even known by that nameihis lab became
the ﬁrst to report that B cells became hyperactive in patients with AIDS.
When a healthy person is invaded by a virus, antibodies mount a
defense, but, when H.I.V. hijacked B cells, the antibody system went
awry. Fauci and his team had identiﬁed one of the crucial features

of AIDS. “We made that observation Without having any idea of what we
were dealing with,” he said in an interview for an NIH. oral history. “I
think that speaks for sound scientiﬁc and clinical observation." The
politics of seeking a cure, though, would be far harder to manage.

On October 1 l, 1988, more than a thousand AIDS activists gathered
outside the headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration, in
Rockville, Maryland, to protest the agency’s glacial reaction to the
epidemic. The activists knew that their community needed new
treatments if they were to avoid catastropheibut they were stymied by
the F.D.A.’s drug—approval process, a remarkably inﬂexible system that
typically took years.

That same day, another group ofprotesters marched onto the campus of
the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland. They were
headed for Building 31, the home of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases. Fauci, who had become the institute’s director
in 1984, was now the government’s leading scientist focussed on

the AIDS epidemic. Even though he was not running the F.D.A., he
appeared almost daily in the media to discuss the crisis. “My face was
the face of the federal government,” Fauci told me. He was asked the
same question nearly every day: why wasn’t the government moving
faster? It didn’t help that the Reagan Administration seemed so
indifferent to the plague.

Fauci watched from his ofﬁce window as activists surrounded the
building and tried to scale its walls. Some were dressed in black robes

NIH Production to ICAN_002298

and carried scythes. Many waved pink-and-black banners, bearing the
words “NIH Wake Up!” or “Stop Killing Us!” All over campus, a chant
could be heard: “Fuck you, Fauci!”

“God, I hated him,” Larry Kramer, the writer and activist who helped
establish the two most important AIDS advocacy groups in the country,
the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and ACT UP, said. “As far as I was
concerned, he was the central focus of evil in the world.” Kramer
attacked Fauci relentlessly in the media. He called him an “incompetent
idiot” and a “pill-pushing” tool of the medical establishment, insulted his
wife, and even compared him to Adolf Eichmann. In 1988, Kramer
published a scathing open letter. “Anthony F auci, you are a murderer,”
he wrote. “Your refusal to hear the screams of AIDS activists early in the
crisis resulted in the deaths of thousands of Queers.”

As the epidemic spread and the death toll rose, it was common for gay
activists to view Fauci and NIAID with rage. Fauci did not control the
drug-approval process, but he was seen as a barrier to opening access to
clinical trials. in which volunteers could receive potentially lifesaving
medications.

For most people infected with H.I.V., taking experimental drugs was the
only alternative to simply waiting for death. Yet the F .D.A.’s arcane
rules prevented the vast majority of patients from qualifying for trials.
For instance, a signiﬁcant number of H.I.V. patients suffered from
pneumoeystis pneumonia. The conditionithe same one observed in the
initial C.D.C. reporticould be fatal, so many who had it used an
experimental antimicrobial medication called pentamidine, which had
proved highly effective. But people who took experimental medications
were barred from participating in other clinical trials.

At first, Fauci held to the standard N.I.H. line that research need not
focus on the immediate welfare of patients. “When we had clinical trials,
we, the scientiﬁc community and the regulatory community, did not
listen” to the activists, he recalled. “It was, at the time, an attitude that
many of us had, and I probably had it myself.” He was right about that. I
covered the AIDS epidemic for the Washington Post, and it was clear to
me that Fauci was inclined to enforce the paternalistic medical tradition
in which he had trained: doctors and scientists were unquestioned

NIH Production to ICAN_002299

authorities, and drug development had to follow a rigid process that
included animal testing and rigorous clinical trials. Otherwise, the
beneﬁts and the risks of these drugs could not be adequately assessed.
In 1987, the FDA. approved the ﬁrst drug to treat H.I.V.i
azidothymidine, or AZTiand the announcement was met with a burst
of hope. But the drug’s liabilities were evident almost instantly. It had
harsh side effects, and the beneﬁts wore off; the virus itself soon became
resistant to the drug. When new clinical studies began, involving
cocktails of AZT and similar compounds, tens of thousands ofpeople
asked to participate. Again, though, volunteers were not accepted if they
used other experimental drugs. The anger among activists grew more
intense. “They started becoming amazingly iconoclastic and
confrontational, and that scared the hell out of the scientists, who were
fundamentally quite conservative,” Fauci told me at his medical—school
reunion. “When they were demonstrating on the NIH. campus,
disrupting Wall Street, disrupting St. Patrick’s Cathedral, instead of
listening to them, scientists withdrew.”

Without entirely understanding his own motives, Fauci decided to look
beyond the activists’ furious rhetoric and style. He recalls telling
himself, “Let me put aside the goth dressithe earrings and the Mohawk
haircuts and the black jacketsiand just listcn to what they have to say.
And what they were saying made absolutely perfect sense.” It helped
that Fauci had something in common with the activists: “They were all
New York guys. I had a little afﬁnity to them because I’m a New
Yorker. And I said, What would I do if I were in their shoes? And it was
very clear: I would have done exactly the same thing.”

The activists knew that they were facing a mercilessly lethal disease. In
the summer of 1985, I travelled to New York to write my ﬁrst long story
on the toll that the epidemic was taking on the city’s gay community. I
interviewed dozens of men. To the best of my knowledge, only two of
them are still alive: Larry Kramer, who is now eighty-four, and a
political activist who prefers to remain anonymous.

Fauci, too. came to understand the severity of the crisis. “Everyone
died,” he said. “I was used to treating people who had little hope and
then saving their livesithat was so wonderful. But, with AIDS in those

NIH Production to ICAN_002300

days, I saved no one. It was the darkest time of my life." Faced with
mounting evidence that his cautious approach made no sense, he did
something that few public officials do: he reversed himself. Fauci
transformed from a conventional bench scientist into a public—health
activist who happened to work for the federal government. “I had to
change,” he told me.

When the demonstrators marched on the NIH. campus in 1988, Fauci
no longer saw a threat. “I looked at them, and I saw people who were in
pain,” he recalled in an article in Holy Cross Magazine. He asked the
police and the FBI. not to arrest any of them. Then he invited a handful
of protest leaders to his ofﬁce. “That began a relationship over many
years,” Fauci said. “They let me into their camp. I went to the gay
bathhouses and spoke to them. I went to San Francisco, to the Castro
District, and I discussed the problems they were having, the degree of
suffering that was going on in the community, the need for them to get
involved in clinical trials, since there were no other possibilities for them
to get access to drugs. And I earned their confidence.”

Fauci, in his mid—forties, was the youngest director of an N.I.H. institute
in a century. and he lacked the political inﬂuence to act independently.
Even in his own ﬁeld, he struggled to recruit allics. “I couldn’t convincc
my own people in infectious-disease leadership to take on HIV/AIDS,”
he told me. So he created a division within his institute devoted to the
disease.

One day, in the late eighties, Fauci asked me to stop by his ofﬁce in
Building 31 on the NIH. campus. He told me that he had a wild idea: he
warrled to hire Mark Harrington, ACT UP’s point man on drug-treatment
trials. Harrington, a prominent AIDS researcher and activist, had no
formal scientific training. But Fauci, like most of those who had seen
him testify before Congress or speak to a crowd, was dazzled by his
brilliance.

Harrington discussed the idea with Fauci, but decided that the job would
be a disaster for him. “There’s no way I could have functioned within
that bureaucracy,” he told me recently. “The people Irespect would have

NIH Production to ICAN_002301

seen me as a sellout.” Yet Harrington continued to make a profound
impression on Fauci’s thinking.

Harrington was passionately committed to loosening up the F.D.A.’s
restrictive regime. “It was murder,” he told me. “I don’t know any other
way to describe it.” Harrington, who went on to win a MacArthur
“genius” grant for his work on the disease, established himself as the
most knowledgeable student of the agency’s byzantine regulations. In
meetings with Fauci and other officials, he urged them to move faster
and with greater compassion for those who were suffering.

There are three stages in most F.D.A. clinical trials. The first tests
whether a drug is safe. The second assesses its efﬁcacy, The last stage,
conducted in larger groups, confirms that the drug works and that there
are no serious adverse reactions. Harrington argued that people with no
alternative should be granted access to those drugs as soon as they had
been proved safe, even if their effectiveness remained unknown.

At first, Fauci was concemed that, if people taking multiple
experimental medications joined clinical trials, the results would be
hopelessly muddled. He was also afraid that granting sick people
unrestricted access to unapproved drugs would deter them from
participating in the trials at all. Harrington and other activists reassured
him that they were committed to strictly monitored drug trials that would
provide enough data to know what worked and what did not.

Fauci is a realist, and the facts were obvious to anyone who cared to
look. Traditional methods oftesting drugs weren’t working.
Underground networks were growing everywhere. With so

many AIDS patients taking untested medications, federal health ofﬁcials
had to concede that their system was broken. Even the most fundamental
protocol of a clinical trial—giving some participants a placebo—came
into question. In a study conducted in San Francisco in 1989, nearly all
the volunteers had their medicine analyzed, to see whether they were
receiving an active dose. Those who leamed that they had been given
placebos almost invariably dropped out.

“There was a feeling in science that doctors know best, scientists know
best,” Fauci said. “We love our patients, but they don’t really know
what’s best for them. Then, when we dealt with this disease that was

NIH Production to ICAN_002302

brand new—that was frightening, that was killing people in a way that
was historicithe people who were impacted by the disease wanted to
have something to say about how we conducted research.”

There were still moments of confrontation. In May, 1990, hundreds

of ACT UP activists returned to the N.l.l-l., demanding

more AIDS treatments and greater representation of women and people of
color in clinical trials. At a planning session for the protest, a young
activist named Tony Malliai‘is perfonned a rap song called “Storm the
NIH,” which included the lyrics “I don’t know what Fauci thinks, but
this ain’t Denmark, and something stinks.” (Malliaris died ﬁve years
later, still in his early thirties.)

Fauci was undeterred. He threw his inﬂuence behind a program called
Parallel Track, which made unapproved AIDS drugs available as soon as
they were demonstrated to be safe, even as clinical trials were
continuing. The initiative would not have succeeded without Fauci. But
he always acknowledged that his approach had been shaped largely by
the constructive pressure he received from AIDS advocacy groups and
from leaders like Harrington.

This more inclusive approach ushered in a revolution in American
medicine. Patients today demand as much information as possible about
treatments they might receive, and no longer act as if their doctors’
advice came straight from Mt. Olympus. They scour the lntemet,
assemble statistics, and often arrive at the hospital with a folder full of
medical information. The FDA, for its part, will no longer consider
approving a new drug until it has consulted representatives of groups
who would use it. “There are strict scientific principles that have to be
adhered to in medicine," Fauci told me. “At the same time, a humanistic
touch is needed in dealing with people. You have to combine social
aspects, ethical aspects, personal aspects with cold, clean science.”

In 2002, I wrote a Profile of Larry Kramer for this magazine. By then, he
and Fauci had become friends. with each expressing gratitude for the
other’s work in those years. Fauci told me, “In American medicine, there
are two eras: before Larry and after Larry. There is no question in my
mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country. When all the

NIH Production to ICAN_002303

screaming and the histrionics are forgotten, that will remain.” Kramer,
who spent years in a constant rage at Fauci, now calls him “the only true
and great hero” among govemment ofﬁcials in the AIDS crisis.

As Trump defends his Administration’s response to the pandemic, he
has suggested repeatedly that COVID-19 was impossible to predict.
“There’s never been anything like this in history,” he said, at a press
conference on March 19th. “Nobody knew there would be a pandemic or
epidemic of this proportion.”

As everyone with even a casual interest in the history of science knows,
pandemics have altered the destiny of humanity at least since 430 BC,
when Athens was struck by a plague that killed as many as two-thirds of
its residents, just as the Spartans were laying siege. Beginning in 165
AD, smallpox helped ruin the Roman Empire, sowing more destruction
than foreign armies ever could. And, in the fourteenth century, the Black
Death swept through Europe, killing more than half the population,
according to recent estimates.

Yet, by the middle of the twentieth century, many scientists had begun
to conceive of a world that was largely free of infectious epidemics. In
1951. Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, a future Nobel laureate in medicine,
wrote, “The fcvcr hospitals are vanishing or being turned to other uses.
With full use of the knowledge we already possess, the effective control
of every important infectious disease7’7with the exception of polioi“is
possible.” His optimism was understandable. Antibiotics had made
many lethal diseases easy to treat; improvements in sanitary conditions
had transformed the lives of hundreds of millions ofpeople. In
developed countries, typhoid, cholera, and measles—major killers
throughout history—had largely passed into memory; even tuberculosis,
one of the great scourges of humanity, had been in decline for nearly
half a century. By 1972, Macfarlane, writing with the microbiologist
David White, was predicting that the “most likely forecast about the
future of infectious diseases is that it will be very dull.”

When Fauci was a young trainee, these kinds of predictions sometimes
made him wonder if he had picked the wrong career. “I became

NIH Production to ICAN_002304

concerned that l was entering . . . an area of biomedical research that
was disappearing,” he recalled in one speech. But, since 1984, when
Fauci became the director of NIAID, there has not been a single day in
which some epidemic has not threatened the globe. According to the
World Health Organization, AIDS has killed more than thirty million
people, and nearly forty million are now living with H.I.V. Tuberculosis,
far from sliding into obscurity, infects roughly a quarter of the human
population; the WHO. says that one and a half million people died from
the disease in 20] 8.

But the greatest tlu‘eat that humanity faces, by far, is a global outbreak of
a lethal virus for which no treatment has been found. In just a few
months, COVID—l 9 has forced billions of people, in nearly every country
on earth, into a panicked withdrawal from society. Another pandemic
like this might appear in two years, or in ten, or in a century. But I have
never met a virologist or an epidemiologist who believes we won’t
encounter one.

For a deadly virus to ﬂourish, it must meet three critical conditions.
First, a new virusione to which no one has yet developed immunityi
must emerge from the animal reservoirs that produce and harbor such
pathogens. Second, the v1rus has to make humans sick. (The vast
majority do not.) Finally, it must be able to spread efﬁciently, through
coughing, sneezing, or shaking hands. That combination is rare, but,
when it appears, the consequences are almost always disastrous.

The Nobel Prize—winning molecular biologist Joshua Lederberg, who
died in 2008, was for years the world’s most visionary voice about
emerging infectious diseases. “Some people think I am being hysterical,
but there are catastrophes ahead," he once wrote. “We live in
evolutionary competition with microbes—bacteria and viruses. There is
no guarantee that we will be the survivors,”

In 2003, Lederberg joined the future F .D.A. commissioner Margaret
Hamburg and the pandemic specialist Mark Smolinski to edit a seminal
report, in which prominent scientists argued for a much more aggressive
defense of the planet. Titled “Microbial Threats to Health," the report
recommended that the U.S. greatly expand its early—warning systems,
particularly in the developing world. It also urged leaders to strengthen

NIH Production to ICAN_002305

their ability to respond to microbial threats, with new efforts on the
federal, state, and local levels. The recommendations were almost
completely ignored.

The next year, a highly pathogenic form of avian inﬂuenza, HSNl,
leaped from waterfowl to chickens and then to humans. Public—health
ofﬁcials were petriﬁed. In Bangkok, I met with Scott Dowel], who led
the Thailand ofﬁce of the C.D.C.’s International Emerging Infections
Program. “The world just has no idea what it’s going to see if this thing
comes,” he told me. He paused and then reframed his thought. “When,
really. It’s when. I don’t think we can afford the luxury of the word ‘if’
anymore.”

In a sense, the world was lucky with HSNI. Although the U.S. and other
countries mounted a difﬁdent response, the virus turned out to be deadly
but not very contagious. Five years later, the situation was reversed. A
new inﬂuenza virus, designated HlNl, infected nearly a quarter of the
global population before vaccines became widely available. This time,
the virus was highly contagious but not nearly as deadly as most strains
of inﬂuenza. The fact that the outbreak was less virulent than public—
health ofﬁcials had feared created its own danger; by encouraging
complacency, it did more to expose the world to the risk ofa devastating
new pandemic than anything else that had happened in decades.
Although Congress had appropriated money to stockpile antiviral
medications and protective gear, many scientists felt that the effort was
grossly insufficient. “We spend many billions of dollars every year on
missile-defense systems,” Seth Berkley, a medical epidemiologist who
leads the Global Vaccine Alliance, told me. “And yet we will not spend
pennies on the dollar to prepare for a catastrophe that is far more likely
to affect us all.”

After the Ebola outbreak of 2014, Barack Obama implemented one of
Lederberg’s central recommendations: he established the White House’s
National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and
Biodefense, an earlyrwarning system for disease in the developing
world. Trump disbanded it in 2018, as part of an effort to streamline the
NSC. In an appearance before Congress, Fauci was asked if the
decision was a mistake. He responded diplomatically: “l wouldn’t

NIH Production to ICAN_002306

necessarily characterize it as a mistake. I would say we worked very
well with that ofﬁce. It would be nice ifthe ofﬁce was still there.”

The combination of money and political will can have extraordinary
effects on public health. Under the George W. Bush Administration.
Fauci was the principal architect of a landmark program called PEPFAR,
the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

By the time Bush took ofﬁce, therapies for ll.I.V. had become Widely
available in Western countries. But, for millions of people in the
developing world, these drugs were too expensive or too difﬁcult to
obtain. Bush felt that it was unacceptable for the poorest people on earth
to die because they could not afford medication that was dispensed
routinely in the rich world. He asked Fauci to implement an initiative to
prevent and treat H.I.V. on a global scale. It has been uniformly held up
as a model of the ways in which global public-health programs can save
lives. “PEPFAR has turned around declining life expectancies in many
countries and likely saved some countriesieven an entire continenti
from economic ruin,” Harold V armus, a former director of the N.I.H.
and of the National Cancer Institute, wrote in the quarterly

journal Science & Diplomacy.

But Fauci has at times struggled to compel politicians and businesses to
attack the problems that he considers most worrisome. Over the years,
he has become concerned about the possible impact of new viruses,
paiticularly a lethal strain of inﬂuenza. Other viruses are more
consistently deadly; some, like measles, are more contagious. But no
virus that we know ofis capable ofkilling as rapidly and as efficiently.
“We need a major paradigm shift with influenza vaccines,” Fauci told
me, four years ago. “The situation is a mess.”

Because the ﬂu virus evolves so rapidly, experts deciding how to
formulate vaccines can make only a highly educated guess about which
strains are most likely to make people sick. Each February,
epidemiologists study outbreaks around the worldiespecially in the
Southern Hemisphere, where ﬂu season is under way—to assess which
strains might make their way north. The result is always better than

NIH Production to ICAN_002307

nothing. In many years, though, it is woefully inadequate. In the ﬂu
season of 20147] 5, the vaccine protected less than a ﬁfth of the people
who received it. In 2017-18, it worked for a little more than a third.
Fauci has long supported the development of an alternative: a universal
inﬂuenza vaccine, which would provide lasting defense against all
strains. “Similar to tetanus, a universal ﬂu vaccine probably would be
given every ten years.” he said “And, if you get one that is really
universal, you can vaccinate just about everyone in the world.” But such
a vaccine would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and
test—and would replace a product that most consumers already think of
as good enough. No one has come close to raising the money that such a
project will require.

By the beginning of the new millennium, it had become clear that the
next microbial threat might not come from a hat or a duck. It could just
as well be created by a human being. After the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 200], anonymous letters laced with deadly anthrax spores
began arriving at media companies and congressional ofﬁces. In the
following months, twenty—two people were infected by inhaling anthrax
and ﬁve died. Suddenly, biological terror posed an entirely new threati
one that has become only more signiﬁcant and complex in the ensuing
years. In 2016, James Clapper, who was the director ofNational
Intelligence during the Obama Administration, listed gene editing as a
potential weapon of mass destruction. Many scientists were furious, but
he had a point. Researchers have deployed these tools to rewrite the
genes of mosquitoes so that they are unable to transmit malaria. If their
success in the lab translates to the field, it will be a historic triumph. But
the research also raises an alarming possibility: ifa scientist can modify
the genes of an insect to protect people from malaria, he could almost
certainly use the same technology to add a deadly toxin.

Fauci often cites a similar but more immediate paradox. Thanks to
genetic engineering, we are more equipped than ever to respond to the
threat of a Viral pandemic. After the COVID—l9 outbreak began, it took
scientists less than a month to sequence the genome of the virus. By the

NIH Production to ICAN_002308

end of February, the instructions were on the Internet, and the virus had
been rercreated in laboratories around the world, by scientists seeking to
develop drugs and vaccines.

And yet, despite our mastery of molecular biology, we live in an era in
which someone can wake up with an infection in Chinaior France,
Australia, or any other place with an airport—and ﬂy to San Francisco in
time for dinner, spreading the virus long before he suspects that there’s
anything wrong. For most of human histmy, a virus like COVID—l9 might
have killed many people in the community where it originated, but then
stopped spreading. According to a comprehensive analysis carried out
by the T imes, at least four hundred and thirty thousand people have
arrived in the U.S. on direct ﬂights from China since the outbreak began.
Forty thousand have arrived in the two months since Trump imposed
restrictions on travellers from China trying to enter the country.

Fauci insists that an adequate defense against future pandemies will have
to be ﬂexible. “I have been saying for eight, ten years that we should
make a list ofmicrobes and try to develop a basic platform vaccine,” he
told me in 2016. A platform vaccine addresses an entire class ofvirus,
not just a particular strain. “We keep trying to develop a vaccine for one
thingiusually the last oneiand it’s a waste of time,” he said. “Every
time we get hit, it is always something we didn’t expect. So, instead of
predetermining what it is you’re going to prepare for, make universal
platforms.”

Such an approach is eminently possible. Using gene—sequence
information and synthetic DNA, biologists are now capable of making
parts of a vaccine in advance. It takes almost no time to sequence a viral
strain, and with that information it should be possible to complete a
bespoke vaccine in a matter of weeks. “You could build a chassis for the
vaccine, and you would have it on the shelf,” Fauci said. “Then all you
would need to do is insert the gene of the protein you want to express
and make a gazillion doses and send it out.”

There are even more futuristic aspirations: the genomics pioneer J . Craig
Venter has proposed using a sort of 3—D printer to manufacture vaccines
on demand. It is already possible to print the nucleotides that make up
DNA and assemble them. Venter argues that, in the time it takes for an

NIH Production to ICAN_002309

infected person to ﬂy from one side of the world to the other, we should
be able to print, assemble, and administer a vaccine.

To even contemplate creating these kinds of treatments, F auci says,
would require building an entirely new system for making vaccines
before a pandemic arises. But, in addition to the scientiﬁc obstacles, this
would cost billions of dollars, and no company or politician has been
willing to spend the money. Perhaps, just as AIDS transformed our
approach to clinical trials, our experience with COVID—l9 will change our
attitudes about preventing infectious diseases. A proper investment in
both research and emergency preparedness would have prevented at
least some of the unspeakable human loss we are now experiencing and
the economic crash that has just begun.

The COVID-l9 epidemic will eventually fade, but the public will demand
a reckoning. Inevitably, there will be an investigation, along the lines of
the 9/11 Commission, to look into the ramiﬁcations of the President's
denialism, the shortages in testing and medical equipment, and the
dismissal of so many warning signs. Fauci will not necessarily escape
criticism. He is an excellent spokesman for the value of scientiﬁc
research, but he runs a single institute, and he lacks the authority to
broadly reshape our response to pandemics. “The kinds of things we
really dcspcratcly need as foundational tools for dcaling with this stuff
aren’t necessarily research enterprises,” Harold Van'nus told me. “Tony
isn’t running C.D.C. He’s not running FEMA. To tell him to stockpile
defense mechanisms or to move forward surveillance tools into massive
operations around the world—that’s just not his remit.”

Even Fauci’s current value as a scientiﬁc adviser has been limited by the
President’s contempt for expertise. Trump’s coronavirus kitchen cabinet
consists of people like his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has no
medical knowledge or experience managing crisesiyet has been
appointed to direct the response to the biggest medical emergency since
the inﬂuenza pandemic of 1918. Trump has also tumed for advice to Dr.
Mehmet Oz, who for years has endorsed worthless treatments and used
his television show to promote notorious quacks. Trump even seems to
think that his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, should debate F auci about the
value of speciﬁc drugs. When Navarro, who has a doctoral degree in

NIH Production to ICAN_002310

economics, was asked about his medical qualiﬁcations, he said, “I have
a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it’s in
medicine, the law, economies, or whatever.”

Among Navarro’s enthusiasms is the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine,
which he believes could cure COVID—19. There is currently no evidence
to support this conclusion, as Fauei has pointed out on several occasions.
On April 5th, as Trump continued to tout the drug as a miracle cure, a
reporter at the daily brieﬁng asked Fauci to comment. Trump refused to
allow him to speak. In an appearance two days later, Trump kept up the
hype. “I say try it.” he said. “You’re not gonna die from this pill.” Not
long afterward, he even suggested that zine might help.

To plan a coherent biological future, rather than simply scramble to
contain each new pandemic, will require an entirely new kind of
political commitment. It would certainly include the creation of a
permanent position, a special assistant to the President for biological
defense. Similar jobs have existed in the past, but not for long, and not
with enough inﬂuence to matter. David Relman, the Stanford professor,
told me, “This kind of job needs somebody with the authority to preside
over domestic and international threats, both natural and deliberate. And
that person has to sit in the White House with immediate access to the
President. Without that, we will really have nothing that can work.”
Until then, we have Fauei, a seventy-nine-year-old infectious-disease
expert pinned between Donald Trump and the American people. It can’t
be easy. As Fauei recently put it, with characteristic candor, “I give the
appearance of being optimistic. But, deep down, Ijust do everything I
possibly can, assuming that the worst will happen, and I’ve got to stop

the worst from happening.” 9

WASHINGTON (The BorUWitz Regort)7ln what he described as a "potentially major breakthrough,” Dr.
Anthony Fauci hasconvinced Donald Ter2 to attack cal/10719 as if it were an inspector general.

Fauci, who has been frustrated in his efforts to get through to Trump, compared the global pandemic to
an inspector general while in a closed-door meeting with the President on Wednesday.

"What do you hate more than anything, Mr. President?” Fauci asked.

"Jim Acosta,” Trump immediately replied.

"0.K., fine. But, besides Jim Acosta," Fauci said, "it would be an inspector general, right?"

"You're right. Tony," Trump agreed. “i hate those losers."

“Well, think of (own—19 as the worst inspector general in the world," Fauci Continued "lt's overseeing
everything you do and making you ioiiow the law. It’s keeping you from spending taxpayer money on
anything you want Vou wouldn’t stand iorthat, would you?"

Reportedly, Trump appeared shaken by Fauci’s analogy. ”Damn it, Tony, when you out it that way, we’ve
got to do something about CUVIDle,” he said.

Speaking to reporters, Fauci said that he was “cautiously optimistic” that his inspector-general analogy
would finally spur Trump to action, but added, “Jared could still screw this up."

tentative date for the event is between April 20 and April 30, but they are waiting to

For my syndicated column, I want to do a piece on the racial aspect of coronavirus. I'm not seeing any breakdown
of deaths in the poorer areas as opposed to ‘he more prosperous ones.

Isn’t that the telling statistic here that the economically less well offlivc in areas where medical services are
inadequate and as a result they have more underlying conditions that make theM more vulnerable? Isn't it relevant
that people of color are predominantly among the poorer in our country for a variety of reasons'.l

Subject: last questions, ipromise

Hi. Mostly these are two second yes or no answers - though I need to understand
the b cell issue better.

Thank you for all this. Hang in there:

1.)

Fauci has at times struggled to compel politicians and businesses to attack the problems
that he considers most worrisome Over the years, he has become especially concerned about
the possible impact of a lethal strain of inﬂuenza.“ True, but I almost qualiﬁed the

NIH Production to ICAN_002346

statement and said it most likely would be inﬂuenza, but I was concerned with any type
of novel respiratory virus that etl'lciently spread from human to human and that had a
high degree of morbidity and mortality

2.) Dyker Helghts versus Bensonhurst:
o

o What do we say about where he grew up? He always says Bensonhurst. The
apartment was technically in Dyker Heights. though the neighborhood lines shift.
And I never see him mention moving neighborhoods, Did he move? Yes. I
moved. I was born al_n the middle hr the Bensnnhurst section

ar Brooklyn. When l was 9 years old my father opened a Pharmacy oh syn-13‘“
Avenue at the outer edge of the Dyker Heights Section of Brooklyn (only We
moved into an apartment over the pharmacy.

3.) [ tlle question below is the meaning of hyperactive. Does it mean producing too
many B cells or that they were too active, as in working too hard, producing too many
antibodies??] Nut necessarily too many 3 cells. It means that the B cells that are there,
are aberrantly turned on

He had been investigating B-cells, which are involved in the production of antibodies.
In 19834before HrIiVi was even known by that nameihis lah became the ﬁrst to report that
B-cells became hyperactive in patients with AIDS. The virus was somehow leading its hosts
to overproduce a defense that normally would keep them healthy. Fauci had identiﬁed one of
the Crucial features of AIDS. "We made that observation without having any idea of what we
were dealing with,” he said. “I think that speaks for sound scientiﬁc and clinical observation."
The politics of seeking a cure, though, would be far harder to manage.

O 4.). This I asked before you could not speak to me but we can take me out of it. Or
do whatever you like: I asked Fauci if he thought that novel coronavirus would
force a Chan e in attitude anion olitical leaders and fundin a encies.

 

5.). This you have said in more than one place. People kind of became alarmed when you
were absent sojusl want to be sure you don’t lnind il in here: No problem.

Fauci said that there was nothing meaningful about his absence from the Mar.23
White House brieﬁng. “I was tied up in a task force meeting, and we were trying to work out
some difﬁcult policies and the topic of the brieﬁng that day was more related to other
members of the Task Force. He also said. “I have no trouble with the President. When I talk
to him, he listens. "

fill their monthly prescription of Lilly insulin for $35. The program is effective today and

NIH Production to ICAN_002352

covers most Lilly insulins. Details and more information can be found in the press release
here attached.

Lilly has introduced several solutions in recent years to help meet the individual financial
circumstances of people living with diabetes that are still in effect during the COVlD-IQ
crisis, including:

0 The Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, through which representatives can direct
people to the $35 savings card, as well as affordability options that may reduce
their uut-of-pockel costs furtheri such as free insulin for people with minimal
income, or no income at all. that has been donated by Lilly to non-proﬁt
organizations.

I Three non-branded versions of our insulin options with list prices 50 percent lower
than the branded versions

0 In January. the company announced plans to donate at least 200,000 KwikPens® ta
relief agencies over the next three years.

Hope all is well with you...

Subject: Supporting Schools In Covid-19

Dr. Fauci —

I‘m a safety/security consultant to independent and charter schools. I run a ﬁrm supporting
~1,000 ofthem. What, if anything, would you want them to know? I'm wondering if there's
any chance in the world you'd be willing to join us and a few hundred schools for a 15 - 30-
minute webinar one day next week?

Speciﬁcally, schools are looking for intbrmation/perspective as it relates to what to expect as we
return to a new normal and the like. Beyond that, they’ve begun to ask questions such as what we
can be thinking about for this short period oftimc between the return to school and the
development ofa vaccine. What would best practice look like for us to educate, but maintain
social distance? I believe we can manage a lot of the operationalizing but would be

immensely grateful for some high-level guidance to follow

I recognize how incredibly busy this time is for you and would be so incredibly grateful for any
time you might be willing to spare for this audience.

With immense gratitude,

Hi Courtney,

15‘. I hope you, yourfamily and your loved ones are harboring safely through this storm. 2"“, thanks for
your efforts and those of Dr. Fauci-he is truly a national treasure during this crisis and it is deeply
appreciated.

I appreciate your help and introductions on how our players can be helpful. As you know Drew and
Brittany Brees made a $5M contribution to the Louisiana coronavirus efforts and they have done a lot of
press. Drew’s message has been "Hang in there—hang toughl We are in this together.”

We done several webinars with our players and their families, both educating them and pointing out
their role both with friends and family as well as on social media to let NFL fans know that whether or
not we have an NFL season dependsto a large extent upon those fans following the guidelines
zealouslyeas zealously as they follow NFL games!

That message seems to be getting through.

l write new with a request for a little bit of Dr. Fauci's time in about 2 weeks. I requested that we stand
up a joint NFLPA»N FL Task Force to scenario plan a pathway to getting NFL Club facilities open, with a
view towards if and when we might look towards an NFL season, even if games are played with no fans.
My request is to have Dr. Fauci give a telephone briefing to our group on this difficult topic, which would
of course be confidential, The floor would be his and I can brief him prior to the call on what we have
been working on. If he were willing, we can do the call anytime, probably during the week of April 13,
although of course the modeling shows that would be during the peak of the outbreak. We could also
do it theweek before or after.

Thanks so much forconsidering this. We are mindful of the psychological toll the virus is taking and the
lift NFL games would give to a sports-starved population. but only if it can be done safely for the players
and the fans who (ultimately) allow them to play this great game.

Again, thanksl

Best,

Doc

Subject: Hello

Dr. Glass,

NIH Production to ICAN_002367

I hope you are well and I wanted to check in to see how you are doing in
this scary and traumatic time for our world.

During these times, I'm especially thankful for the training I
received from the Fogarty Institute. I remember your wise words
at our Fogarty orientation in 2011- on why investing in Global
health is so critical. No truer words have been spoken especially at
times like these!

I'm currently communicating with my former colleagues in Zambia
(Mpanji and Innocent pictured here with

me https www.thermofisher com/biog behindthebench usingesangensequencingrtor
detect-dru -resistance-mutations-in-hiv-in-zambia ) from CIDRZ to see how
testing can be brought up via the public health infrastructure in
place currently. Thankfully, the number of cases is very low,
although the unreported cases are much higher than likely
captured
(https:j/www.arcgis.comjagps/ppsdashboardjindex.html#jbd37594740fd40299423467b4
Begecfs). My friend who is a Lieutenant Physician actually likely
contracted COVID—19 in January and wrote that she and others
had treated a patient returning from Wuhan who was pregnant of
respiratory illness upon coming back to Lusaka to deliver, only to
die of pleural effusion later. They subsequently developed flu-like
symptoms and resolved, but these are the types of cases that
likely go undetected and can potentially contribute to community
spread of the disease.

 

Thank you again for being such a wonderful role model, and I look
to leaders like you and Dr. Fauci to help our nation think with
prudent but difficult decisions.

Kind regards,
Lillian

Volume 15

From the Neighborhood

by Frank Derosa

Frank DeRosa retired as Associate Publisher of The
Tablet and director of the Diocesan Public
Information Office in 2008

When I see Dr. Anthony Fauci on the TV screen
explaining expertly

everything we need to know about the
coronavirus pandemic, | find myself thinking
back to his father, Stephen Fauci. whose
drugstore our family relied on back in the 19505.

Steve Fauci was the neighborhood pharmacist.

The Fauci Pharmacy stood on the southwest
corner of 13 th Ave. and 83 rd St., in the Dyker
Heights section of Brooklyn, diagonally across
from the Shrine Church of St. Bernadette. We
lived two blocks away on 85th .

 

NIH Production to ICAN_002400

Long ago parishioners like me remember what
the store looked like, the

soda fountain that ran along the right wall, the
telephone booths at the left close to the
entrance and the counter straight ahead down
the center.

Whenever my mother sent me there, Mr. Fauci
would be behind the

counter, but it was a family enterprise. They
lived in an apartment above the store, and if the
patriarch wasn’t serving you, his wife, Eugenia,
or daughter, Denise, was there. Young Anthony,
I’ve since learned, pitched in too, his father
sending him out on his bike to deliver items to
customers.

I’ve never met the man who has become the
most important medical voice in the country. Nor
have former parishioners that I’ve spoken to
about him in recent days, like boyhood pals
Anthony LoFrisco, from

80th St., now in Connecticut, and Bob Orlando,
who lived on 84th, now a New Jersey resident,
as well as Bishop Gerald Barbarito of the Palm
Beach Diocese, from 11th Ave. But each
remembers the pharmacy as a Dyker Heights
institution.

 

NIH Production to ICAN_002401

While we don’t know him personally, in a sense
he’s become everyone’s

friend. With his steady television presence, he’s
imparted his vast knowledge and
straightforward advice in a trademark,
sometimes gravelly or raspy, Brooklyn accent
that has endeared him to people far and wide.
You can’t be anything but proud of someone of
his prominence who came from the parish.

Anthony became known as Tony, as he tells it,
when Father Flanagan,

principal of Regis High School, decided to call
him that on his first day as a freshman. The
name stuck.

Tony took buses and trains to the Jesuit school
in Manhattan, including the old Sea Beach
Express. He traveled 70 minutes each way, did
three hours of homework, captained the
basketball team and excelled in the classroom.

I remember hearing that when Tony was a high
schooler, he had a part-

time job working in St. Bernadette’s rectory,
answering the phone and doing whatever else
parishioners wanted him to do to put them in
touch with one of the parish priests. In those
days, the rectory had a priestly bonanza. There

 

NIH Production to ICAN_002402

were four of them.

Because St. Bernadette’s School had not yet
been established, Tony went to Our Lady of
Guadalupe School, where he was taught by
Dominican Sisters. It was, and is, St.
Bernadette’s neighboring parish.

Like most kids, he loved sports. He played CYO
baseball and basketball. At Dyker Park on 86th
St., he and his friends developed skills in
imitation of their heroes. A Yankee follower
living in the midst of Brooklyn Dodgers fans who
adored The Boys of Summer, he’s said his

favorite players were Joe DiMaggio and Mickey
Mantle.

Tony’s father and mother married at 18, after
they graduated from New

Utrecht High School. Steve went on to Columbia
to study pharmacy.

Sometime after he opened his pharmacy, he
became friends with Father AI Varriale, one of St.
Bernadette’s beloved parish priests. At one
point, Steve, as a parent, and the priest known
as Father V, who directed the parish’s robust
CYO sports program for youths, shared a
concern. It was the easy availability of indecent

 

NIH Production to ICAN_002403

and immoral publications that they knew was a
threat to the moral development of young
people.

So, with the approval and support of the Diocese
of Brooklyn, together they formed a diocesan
commission against pornography. Both men are
now long gone, and so is the commission, but it
was a good idea, though it did not survive them.

Remarkably, just a few houses up the block from
where Steve established his pharmacy, lived the
Pellegrinos, another family of St. Bernadette’s
parishioners that produced a renowned medical
professional. The eldest son, Edmund, became a
bioethicist, a “preeminent” one, as one
newspaper described him after he died. But he
was more. He helped develop medical programs
at Kentucky, Stony Brook and Tennessee
Universities. Later, he took on the presidency of
The Catholic University of America. Then, after
completing his tenure there, he became, as
physician and philosopher, the director of the
Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown
University.

Though years apart in age, both Dr. Fauci and
Dr. Pellegrino became
Hippocratic stars, nurtured on the same block.

 

NIH Production to ICAN_002404

Only in Brooklyn, I say, not without bias.

Steve Fauci was known by members of his
extended family and friends for his personality,
kindness, sense of humor and wit, and for telling
good stories. So they said in comments after he
died in 2008.

Tony appears to have inherited Steve’s gene for
lightheartedness. His

daughter once told the Washington Post that her
dad could be a “goofball. . .he works hard and
does his thing, but he comes home and he’s
singing opera in the kitchen and dancing
around.”

That kind of calm can help a man maintain his
balance as he deals with the pressure of talking
to millions of people every day about the
complexity of a global pandemic.

As one newsman said, “When Fauci appears on
the screen, you turn up the volume.”

He once said the Jesuits at Regis and Holy
Cross College taught him the

importance of “precision of thought and
economy of expression.”

 

NIH Production to ICAN_002405

That’s what he delivers every day: accurate
information given concisely.

That’s Tony Fauci, now a national treasure. And
to think, he came from the neighborhood.

Dr. Anthony Fauci He graduated from Regis
High School and the
College of Holy Cross.
He graduated number
one in his class at
Cornell Medical School
in 1966.

He completed his
medical residency at
New York Hospital

In 1984, he became
director of National
Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. a
position he holds today.

Subject: Another Possible Tool in The Fight Against SARS'COVcZ ?

Dr. Fauci---Forgive the crude and unsolicited manner in which I am attempting to reach out to
you but] don't really KNOW any other way!

lam not a medical doctor nor am | a principle investigator. l amjust a Cytologist employed in
the Anatomic Pathology department at LA County7USC Medical Center here in Southern
California.

But I have been reading a lot» and in my own exploration 1 have come across several articles
which suggest the possibility of using a class of agents called

SPHINGOSINEJ-PHOSPHATE RECEPTOR AGONISTS in combination with antivirals like
oseltamivir (or perhaps Remdesivir?) to treat both the viral pathogen responsible for the
current pandemic as well as the runaway immune response of the host leading to the oft fatal
cytokine storms.

Apparently these compounds have been approved for flare—ups of multiple sclerosis, and have
even been tried on Alzheimer's patients. The commonly known drug is FlNGOLlMOD. But these
papers that l have cited for you below seem to indicate that structural analogs of this
compound could be important in damping down the dysregulated pro»inflammatory cascades
which seem to be leading to DIC, alveolar exudates and diffuse alveolar damage, capillary leak
syndrome and ultimately the multiple organ failure that is killing an unacceptably high number
of people.

The fly in the ointment Dr. Fauci here is that these S»1»PR agonists have only been
demonstrated to be effective in non-human primates and other mammals. And much ofthese
studies on these compounds has been done not on coronaviruses but on influenza viruses.

So it would be a gamble. But is that not how we have learned much about human health and
disease is by the gracious sacrifice of our animal cousins ? And might it not be a general effect
that these sphingosine derivatives have on viral sepsis so that maybe what works for influenza
might work for the coronavirus?

In the dire situation that many ofthe most critically ill COVID 19 patients find themselves, it
seems they are on the precipice of a rapid demise once they begin to show certain key
laboratory results-«(spikes in D—DlMER, C-Reactive Protein, Serum Ferritin, prolongation of

NIH Production to ICAN_002408

prothrombin and APTI’, increased cardiac troponin 1, surges in IL-6, IL-7, monocytic and
macrophage chemo»attractant cytokines etc).

With patients isolated by these aberrant lab values, the window may be narrow but it may be a
time where application of antiviral compounds in combination with these inflammatory
modulators could have a striking impact on mortality? Indeed maybe even TWO different
antivirals with differing mechanisms ofaction in combination with these Sl-PR Agonists would
even be better. And the possibilities of other combinations of course would be there for
further exploration.

Fully cognizant of the Hippocratic Oath to 'first do no harm‘ I still believe that at least the
medical rationale is sound for the inclusion of these agents into the possible arsenal of

therapeutics for the more severe COVID 19 patients.

Please refer below to the studies I found particularly helpful or promising. Perhaps you can put
together some 'teams’ to further explore investigate these options ??

We all appreciate everything you have done, and continue to do !

Dear David et al.,

Thanks for forwarding this very thoughtful document, which presents a series of
important recommendations — most of which I agree with. I don’t know if you saw
Friday’s announcement (attached) of the new public private partnership called
ACTlV (for Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines), but it
has taken on most of the points you raise in sections 1— 3 of your letter. I share
your hopes that remdesivir will show benefit, and the current large NIH-sponsored
RCT has completed enrollment and should reveal results in about a month. But of
course we want to test multiple other interventions — both small molecules and
antibody-based therapies, so we need ourtrlal system to be optimized like never
before. I will share your letter with the leaders of ACTlV, who are working with
unprecedented speed to prioritize the next set oftherapeutic candidates as well as
pushing vaccine development programs to adopt exceptionally creative trial
designs to test safety and efficacy (With full engagement by FDA).

NIH Production to ICAN_002422

Dear Francis,
I hope you are well.

| write on behalf of a group of citizen-scientists, most or all of whom you know, Motivated
solely by our desire to help defeat the seriousthreat our nation and the world now faces,
we wrote a set of four actionable, nonrpartisan proposals (attached) to produce safe and
effective COVlD-lﬁ therapeutics and vaccines in the shortest possible timeframe, and to
reopen our society in a manner that reduces the risk of future COVID-19 outbreaks.

We hope you find these ideas interesting, and might be willing to share this set of
proposals with Dr, Tony Fauci, along with our willingness to discuss any part of the
proposals with him ifwe can be helpful. We understand from our efforts to contact Dr.
Fauci through email routes that his standard inbox may be too overwhelmed for our
proposal to reach him.

The four proposals attached describe (1) How to rapidly repurpose an antiviral drug to
treat COV|D~19 patients; (2) How to expedite the development of human antibody drugs to
treat patients and to provide shortvterm protection for healthy indivrouals; (5) How to
develop C0V|0719 vaccines on an expedited time scale; and (4) How to reopen our
businesses and schools in a manner that reduces the risk of future outbreaks and deaths.

Thank you for any help or thoughts you might be able to provide.

Dear Tony,

l have always felt reassured when the good Dr. Fauci speaks, and now more than ever. As
an American, a former colleague, a longtime admirer and student of your wisdom ethank
you. We are all safer because ofyou, and the world will be a better place because of

you. Again.

As you know, I am now leading the ONE Campaign. We’ve been quite active with the
ONEWorld Campaign, dedicated to the fight against this newest virus, and focused on
Africa. We’ve made some progress on debt, and next up is a focus on ensuring that a
vaccine, when it comes, is available to everyone.

One of the things we want to do is educate people, in all of the places we work. It won’t
surprise you that of particular urgency amongst our partners in Africa is that facts and
information get to people across the continent, but we also know that more facts are
needed everywhere. So next month we are going to launch #PassTheMic, where every day
for 19 days we will ask a celebrity to turn his or hersocial media channels overto an expert
on COVID-IS for one day. Solulia Roberts might turn her Twitter account to you to talk
about the critical elements neeced to flatten the curve and slow the spread. Or ldris Elba
could give up his lnstagram to the head of the African CDC so that he can illustrate the
impact COVlD-19 will have across Africa and what that means for the rest of the world.

We know artists want to be helpful right now, but that it is hard to know what to do. And
we know there are experts like you out there who have the answers. We’ve thought about
this a lot at ONE and wanted to do something we felt would truly have an impact. As we
lookahead we know COVID~19 does not know borders and until it is beaten everywhere

NIH Production to ICAN_002429

we are not in the clear We need a global response plan and we need it now. By turning
over their platforms for the day, celebrity influencers will be donating one of their biggest
assets —- their followers a to VOU, giving you the platform you need (and we all need) to tell
the world why a global response is criticaL Because none of us are safe until all of us are
safe‘

We will work with each expert/celebrity pair to personalize the content to our and our
celebrity partners’ audiences a in North America, Europe and Africa, and help create
content that both parties are happy with, We are now confirming our talent partners, and
so far are getting a terrific response,

We know you're a busy man, so we've planned it so that the amount of time on your end
would be minimal. But the impact would be maximal,

I’m attaching more information about the campaign Please let me know what you think
and if you have questions. Ideally we would like to get this off the ground in early May, so
are hoping to confirm folks by April 28th at the latest‘ Our team will be in touch with your
office to follow up.

Thanks as always for everything you do. All my best to you, Gayle

Subject: Platelet Donations Down are Down Amid Coronavirus Outbreak -- Please Donate

Dear Colleagues-

The NIH Platelet Donor Center has an urgent need for healthy individuals to give lifesaving
platelets to patients. The need for platelet donations is especially acute now with the
coronavirus pandemic. While sociai distancing and increased telework are necessary to
contain and slow the spread of coronavirus. we have seen a marked decline in platelet and
blood donations for our patients.

To alleviate this shortage, NlAlD and the Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) are
co-sponsoring a two-week Plateiet Drive from March 30 — April 10. Platelet collections. as
well as whole blood and Double Red Cell donations, can only be made at the NIH Blood
Bank on campus in Building 10, Room 1C713 Mondaythrough Friday from 8:00 am to 5:00
pm. The Piatelet Center at Fishers Lane is temporarily closed and platelet coilections are
now on the main campus through at least the next 30 days. This move helps to ensure that
blood donors are protected by visitor screening. minimizing possible exposure to
individuals at risk.

What is a double red ceil donation? A double red cell donation enables donors to donate
two units of red blood cells in one visit. During a procedure called apheresis. whole blood is
separated through a celi separatorand red blood cellsare collected. The remainder of the
blood components are returned to the donor along with saline to replace the lost voiume.

I encourage participation of all employees who are eligible to provide a donation to benefit
our NIH patients. I understand employees may be hesitant to participate underthe current
conditions, but i would like to reassure you that blood donation is a sale process.
Additional precautions have been put in place at our Blood Bank to help prevent the
spread of infection and protect the health of donors and staff.

 

Thank you to all who support our quarterly platelet drives. Vour efforts provide a lifeline
for our patients. Those who participated in the last drive are now eligible to help once
again. in appreciation of your dedication to helping others, NIAID grants administrative
leave to any NIAID federal employee who donates platelets at the NIH Blood Bank.
Specifically, you Will be granted 4 hours of administrative leave to be used immediately
following your platelet donation appointment. As always with such activities, piease notify
your supervisor for approval prior to donating at the NIH Plateiet Centen Contractor
empioyees should speak directly to their contract companies to determine what leave

NIH Production to ICAN_002434

options are available. Please contact the Donor Center at 301-496-4321 to schedule your
appointment. Let the Donor Center staff know you are with the NIAID Platelet/Double Red
Cell Drive. They will answer eligibilityquestions and provide information about the
donation process.

Thank you for considering donating during this stressful time. Best regards.

Please take a look at this. This question evolved from a teleconference that I
had 2 nights ago with people ”in the trenches” including Alison Arwady
(Chicago). The question is what will be the relationship between the public
health workforces at the federal and local levels. Youi had spoken of the CDC
people that will be assigned locally and that will help build up a local workforce.
How will CDD interact and relate to the locals. Is there any possibility of Federal
funding of their proposal (see attachment). If not, do you have any suggestions
for them? I can discuss this with you today at the Task Force meeting. Thanks.

Subject: Dr, Fauci asked me to send Chicago question
Dear Patty,

Last night on his call with public health leaders from cities across the country, Dr. Fauci asked me to
send him/you my follow—up question from Chicago:

How will the necessary public health workforce expansion (e.g. for wide-scale case investigation,
contact tracing, linkage to care, community testing, and vaccination) be supported at the federal
level?

Our understanding is that state or loca jurisdictions will be able to develop their own workforces rather
than supporting a single workforce at the federal level, and we agree with this approach, but it would be
very helpful to understand next steps and potential timelines, particularly as the reopening drumbeat
gets louder.

For example, Chicago has developed a local plan/proposal (attached) that would meet our local needs,
help address some of our underlying race and economic equity concerns, and build on our existing
communitvand clinical partnerships. We have shared it with some partners, but it is not atall clear
how/whether/when/how much funding might be available. Given the need to quickly expand our
workforce and plan ahead, it would bevery helpful to get a sense of:

E”

How much funding/support might be available, and how that will be determined

b. Whether funding might come through HHS/CDC (our preferred mechanism), FEMA, or another
mechanism

6, Will support be available in weeks or months...and for how long—we are strongly advocating
for 5 years, similar to what was done for Ebola

cl. Any other information about how our local or state plans need to be adapted to fit into federal

thinking on this approach

Thank you so much, I deeply appreciate Drt Fauci taking the time to meet with us directly and hear our
concerns.

l-lello - Thanks for all for a very infomative and sobering discussion last night. I've provided

short but can supply a full recording of the call if you want it.

PPE supplies:

- while hospitals are in better shape than a few weeks ago, signiﬁcant shorlages remain at long-
term care facilitates, skilled nursing facilitates, outpatient settings like doctors' ofﬁces and urgent
care clinics, shelters, prisons. Gowns are the biggest problem, but gloves, masks and shields are
also short. Doctors ofﬁces are closing for lack ofPPE.

- each City is trying to solve these shortages in a short-term, piecemeal way. They need a longer-
term solution to stabilize availability. Outpatient settings are looking to health departments to
provide supplies, something HDs are not set up to do.

— testing in most places still requires PPE use (e. g. no availability of anterior nasal swabs) and the
PPE shortages are severely limiting testing scale up.

, even at hospitals. supply limitations make reropening elective surgeries and other procedures
impossible at this stage.

- Ifconsidering re-opening businesses, this will drastically increase PPE needs to a whole new
sectorr

TESTING challenges:

- Each city reported that, despite improvements, a very limited number of tests are being
performed compared to need.

- Supply shortages are the biggest challenge: swabs, PPE, sample kits, reagents are
the biggest obstacles. Not clear where this is going to come from or who is responsible
for addressing problems.

- Private labs limit number of sample Kits distributed each week. In places where public
labs are available, there is a push to get providers to use the public labs, But many
places don't have public labs.

- There is no clear guidance on how to prioritize who gets tested ﬁrst. So, in some places, that
means that people at lower-risk are being testing but people at greater risk (due to symptoms,

NIH Production to ICAN_002442

exposure, high-risk living/work enVironment, etc) are not being testing. Guidelines are needed
to help prioritize where testing resources are used first.

- Public testing produces skewed results. Testing becomes available only to those who
can make an appointment and who can drive to the site. This means many lower-
priority people get tested but highepriority people do not. This skews understanding of
positivity rates.

- Some labs are underutilized - but the reason is that there are breakdowns in the supply chain
that make it difficult to test people and get tests to the labs. (e.g.) 00(4)

- Reimbursement is an obstacle. CMS offering to cover test costs ($100 per test) would help get
labs to do more testing. It would not solve the problem, but it would help.

- Proliferation of unvalidated antibody tests is causing confusion. High rates of false results,
misinterpretation of what results mean (clg, telling people who test antibody positive that they
must quarantine for two weeks), Chicago spends a lot time shutting down these testing sites as
they make things harder and use up supplies.

- there is increasing pressure to reach a target number oftests performed each day in order to get
to 're—opening', But the number needed is contextual based on the environment, population -
there isn't one 'right' number for everywhere,

» Need better public messaging on difference between virology and serologic tests.

- Current testing capacity is no where near what is needed to make informed decisions about re-
opening,

TESTING: reporting challenges

» Current PoC tests have no link to provide results to health departments. Many outpatient
facilities and SNFs have no system for reporting test results to HDs. Need electronic link for
reporting PoC test results.

- While aggregate positive tests may be reported, negative results are not.

- Impossible to really understand population levels of infection because (1) number oftests
perfomied is too low and (2) not testing the 'right' people

- Every one is pushing for rapid scale up of antibody tests, but we still don‘t know what the
results of these tests mean and how to apply them to policy development.

- CDC and NIH will each coordinate sero-surveys. No details on CDC approach yet. NIH study
is up, Still not clear how to use the results of these studies, but useful to collect data now and
apply it as knowledge grows. Locally-coordinate aero-surveys can be helpful but only if tests are
highly validated.

The Future:

- How many tests should we being c'oing'? How much PPE/testings/beds/staff will be needed in
the coming year? Next winter, we will face dual ﬂu and COVID outbreaks, without stable testing
capacity, how will we differentiate between the two?

- What are the plans for contact tracmg? Who will recruit and train? Is there a federal plan or
guidelines for this? How will it be paid for? What do we do to effectively isolate those infected?

Please find attached for your review a draft press release describing the launch of the ACTG
hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin study for COVlD-19, NIAID will issue the release after the first
participant(sl has enrolled, which is currently anticipated around May 1.

The following isthe quote we have drafted for you:
"We urgently need a safe and effective treatment for COVlD-19. Repurposing existing drugs is
an attractive option because these medications have undergone extensive testing, allowing

them to move quickly into clinical trials and accelerating their potential approval for COVlD-19
treatment," said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. "Although there is anecdotal evidence

NIH Production to ICAN_002445

that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may benefit people with COVID-19, we need solid
data from a large randomized, controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental
treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes."

Kathy

Good afternoon Dr Fauci.

We are interested in seeing ifyou would be available for a chat via Zoom to New
anland about COVID-19

The US is an essential part of the NZ economy contributing between $1.5 and $2
billion dollars annually from tourism alone and we would love to have a
conversation about where the US is at, how COVID-19 is being dealt with, and the
future of things that could lead up to opening our borders again.

We're happy to have you for any length oftime, but ifyou have 10-20 minutes that
would be amazing.

Thank you for what you are doing ll’l this global event, I hope we can connect
sometime soon

Sincerely.

Hi Tony,

This is Lou Ignarro from UCLA, You and I shared the stage in the "Shoe" at the Ohio
State University a few years ago, where you gave the Graduation Address to the
undergraduate seniors. I was on stage with you, to receive an award for my basic
biomedical research which resulted in my being awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine
in 1998, I recall the nice conversations we were enjoying with Sanjay Gupta while
robing for the event.

Thanks for the truly spectacularjob you are doing, regarding the coronavirus
pandemic, We Nobel Laureates especially regard your work as the most important
during our lifetime. Thank you and God bless

My best wishes,

Lou Ignarro

In the meantime, I wanted to double check the reference to the study you mentioned about the
east and west coast strains and their potential difference in virulence. Realize it's preliminary,
so just wanted to confirm any references we make to it. i checked the biorxiv and medrxiv but
didn't find the citation. Would appreciate thejournal if it was published. Manythanks! Alice

Jennifer & Courtneyr

Hello! Our friends from Steph Curry’s team passed along your contact information to us
and we work at CAA where we represent World Series Champion, Ryan Zimmerman.

Ryan wanted to express his gratitude first Ktioremost to Dr. Fauci, the entire team and all
those behind the scenes working around the clock.

Ryan recently launched the Pros for Heroes Covid-19 Fund last week, with more than 30
professional athletes supportingand over $300,000 raised across 1,400 separate donations
(>www grosforheroes,org<)l Since its launch last Tuesday, contributions from the Pros For
Heroes Fund have gone directly :owards PPE needs throughout the lnova hospital network
throughout the mid-Atlantic and have helped provide meals to those critical care front-line
workers - keeping these front-line heroes covered at work and comfortable at home,

If Dr, Fauci was upto it, Ryan would love to host either a short 15 minute Q&A on his
Facebook to continue raising awareness for how we need to be responding to the ongoing
crisis, Or even simply thank Dr. Fauci forthe tireless work he is doing and shine a light on
how folks can support these critical trontline workers.

We are also open to what you think would work bestl Would there any openings that
would work best?

We know Dr. Fauci is big baseball fan, and of course we are all huge fans of hisl lfwe can
ever be supportive or help navigate anything in the world of pop culture, please do not
hesrtate to 35k.

A new study by one of China’s top scientists has found the ability of the new coronavirusto mutate has
been vastly underestimated and different strains may account for different impacts ofthe disease in
various parts of the world.

Professor Li Lanjuan and her colleagues from Zhejiang University found within a small pool of patients
many mutations not previously reported. These mutations included changes so rare that scientists had
never considered they might occur.

They also confirmed for the first time with laboratory evidence that certain mutations could create
strains deadlier than others.

“Sars-CoV-Z has acquired mutations capable of substantially changing its pathogenicity," Li and her
collaborators wrote in a nonepeer reviewed paper released on preprint service medeiv.org on Sunday.
Li‘s study provided the first hard evidence that mutation could affect how severely the virus caused
disease or damage in its host.

Li took an unusual approach to investigate the virus mutation. She analysed the viral strains isolated
from 11 randomly chosen Covid»19 patients from Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang, and
then tested how efficiently they could infect and kill cells.

The deadliest mutations in the Zhejiang patients had also been found in most patients across Europe,
while the milder strains were the predominant varieties found in parts of the United States, such as
Washington state. according to their paper.

A separate study had found that New York strains had been imported from Europe. The death rate in
New Vork was similar to that in many European cou ntries. if not worse.

But the weaker mutation did not mean a lower risk for everybody, according to Li's study. In Zhejiang,
two patients in their 305 and 505 who contracted the weaker strain became severely ill. Although both
survived in the end, the elder patient needed treatment in an intensive care unit.

This finding could shed light on differences in regional mortality. The pandemic’s infection and death
rates vary from one country to another, and many explanations have been proposed.

Genetic scientists had noticed that the dominant strains in different geographic regions were inherently
different. Some researchers suspected the varying mortality rates could, in part, be caused by mutations
but they had no direct proof.

The issue was furthercomplicated because survival rates depended on many factors, such as age,
underlying health conditions or even blood type.

In hospitals, Covid-IQ has been treated as one disease and patients have received the same treatment
regardless of the strain they have. Li and her colleagues suggested that defining mutations in a region
might determine actions to fight the virus.

"Drug and vaccine development, while urgent, need to take the impact of these accumulating mutations
into account to avoid potential pitfalls,” they said.

Li was the first scientist to propose the Wuhan lockdown according to state media reports. The
government followed her advice and in late January, the city of more than 11 million residents was shut
down overnight

The sample size in this most recent study was remarkably small, Other studies tracking the virus
mutation usually involved hundreds, or even thousands, ofstrains.

Li’s team detected more than 30 mutations. Among them 19 mutations e or about 60 per cent e were
new.

They found some of these mutations could lead to functional changes in the Virus’ spike protein, a
unique structure over the viral envelope enabling the coronavirus to bind with human cells. Computer
simulation predicted that these mutations would increase its infectivity.

To verify the theory, Li and colleagues infected cells with strains carrying different mutations. The most
aggressive strains could generate 270 times as much viral load as the weakest type. These strains also
killed the cells the fastest.

It was an unexpected result from fewer than a dozen patients, “indicating that the true diversity of the
viral strains is still largely underappreciated,” Li wrote in the paper.

The mutations were genes different from the earliest strain isolated in Wuhan, where the virus was first
detected in late December last year.

The coronavirus changes at an average speed of about one mutation per month. By Monday, more than
10,000 strains had been sequenced by scientists around the globe, containing more than 4,300
mutations, according to the China National Centre for Bioinformation.

Most of these samples, though, were sequenced by a standard approach that could generate a result
quickly. The genes were readjust once, for instance, and there was room for mistakes.

Li's team used a more sophisticated method known as ultra-deep sequencing. Each building blockofthe
Virus genome was read more than 100 times, allowing the researchers to see changes that could have
been overlooked by the conventional approach.

The researchers also found three consecutive changes _ known as tri-nucleotide mutations e in a 60-
year-old patient, which was a rare event. Usually the genes mutated at one site at a time. This patient
spent more than SOdays in hospital, much longer than other Covid-19 patients, and even his faeces
were infectious with living viral strains.

“investigating the functional impact of this trirnucleotide mutation would be highly interesting,” Li and
colleagues said in the paper.

Professor Zhang Xuegong. head of the bioinformatics division at the National Laboratory for lnformation
Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, said ultra-deep sequencing could be an effective
strategy to track the virus’ mutation.

”it can produce some useful information,” he said.

Butthis approach could be much more time consuming and costly. It was unlikely to be applied to all
samples.

”Our understanding ofthe virus remains quite shallow,” Zhang said. Questions such as where the virus
came from, why it could kill some healthy young people while generating no detectable symptoms in
many Ulllers still left scientist: scratching their heads,

”if there is a discovery that overturns the prevailing perception, don’t be surprised.”

Rick Bright HHS

WASHINGTON — Rick Bright, one of the nation's leading vaccine development experts and the director
of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, is no longer leading the organization,
officials told STAT.

The shakeup at the agency, known as BARDA, couldn’t come at a more inopportune time for the office,
which invests in drugs, devices, and other technologies that help address infectious disease outbreaks
and which has been at the center of the government's coronavirus pandemic response.

Bright, whose departure was confirmed by three industry sources and two current Trump administration
sources, will instead move into a narrower role at the National Institutes of Health overseeing a similar
but limited public—private partnership aimed at vaccine development. Gary Disbrow, Bright’s former
deputy at BARDA, will serve as the acting director of the office, an HHS spokesperson confirmed to
STAT.

BARDA was expected to play an even larger role in the coming months; Congress more than tripled
BARDA'S budget in the most recent coronavirus stimulus package. Already, the office has a role in some
ofthe splashiest CovidA19 projects. including partnerships with Johnson & Johnson and Moderna
Therapeutics, both ofwhich are developing potential Covid719 treatments.

Related:

This tiny federal agency was built to respond to a crisis like
coronavirus. Now that it's here, is BARDA ready?

BARDA has been plagued with management issues virtually since its creation in 2006. with much ofthe
criticism aimed at a contracting departmentthat some say is unresponsive to industry partners. The
office has only had two permanent directors since its creation in 2006. Bright has led the organization
since 2016.

None of the sources articulated the reason for Bright’s departure. though several mentioned recent
chafing between Bright and Bob Kadlec. the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response,
which has oversight over BARDA.

An HHS spokesperson confirmed that Bright will work on a recently announced NIH publicrprivate
partnership with 16 drug makers aimed at developing vaccines and treatments for Covid-lg.

"Dr. Rick Bright will transfer the skills he has applied as Director of the [BARDA] to the [NIH]. .. Dr. Bright
brings extensive experience and expertise in facilitating powerful public~private partnerships that
advance the health and well—being of the American people," the spokesperson said

Bright did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Bright’s career has largely centered around vaccine and drug development. His work at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention focused on influenza viruses, antiviral drugs and tests. He has also
worked in the biotechnology industry and served as an advisor to the World Health Organization. Before
becoming BARDA director, he led the agency's influenza and Emerging infectious Diseases Division.

Jennifer 8t Courtneyr

Hellol Our friends from Steph Curry‘s team passed along your contact information to us and we work at
CAA where we represent World Series Champion, Ryan Zimmerman.

Ryan wanted to express his gratitude first a foremost to Dr. Fauci, the entire team and all those behind
the scenes working around the clock.

Ryan recently launched the Pros for He’oes Covid-le Fund last week, with more than 30 professional
athletes supporting and over $300,000 raised across 1,400 separate donations.
(wwwprosforheroesorg). Since its launch last Tuesday, contributions from the Pros For Heroes Fund
have gone directly towards PPE needs throughout the lnova hospital network throughoutthe mid-
Atlantic and have helped provide rnealsto those critical care front»line workers - keeping these front-line
heroes covered at work and comfortabe at home.

if Dr. Fauci was up to it, Ryan would love to host either a short 15 minute Q&A on his Facebook to
continue raising awareness for how we need to be responding to the ongoing crisis. Or even simply thank
Dr, Fauci for the tireless work he is doirg and shine a light on how folks can supportthese critical lrontline
workers,

We are also open to what you think would work bestl Would there any openings that would work best?

We know Dr. Fauci is big baseball fan, and of course we are all huge fans of his! if we can ever be
supportive or help nayigate anything inthe world of pop culture, please do not hesitate to ask,

Warmest Wishes,

implications forthe pandemic. Photo: EPA—EFE

A new study by one of China’s top scientists has found the ability of the new coronavirusto mutate has
been vastly underestimated and different strains may account for different impacts of the disease in
various parts of the world,

Professor Li Lanjuan and her colleagues from Zhejiang University found within a small pool of patients
many mutations not previously reported. These mutations included changes so rare that scientists had
never considered they might occu r.

They also confirmed for the first time with laboratory evidence that certain mutations could create
strains deadlier than others.

"SarsrConZ has acqmred mutations capable of substantially changing its pathogenicity,” Li and her
collaborators wrote in a non—peer reviewed paper released on preprint service medeiv.org on Sunday.
Li’s study provided the first hard evidence that mutation could affect how severely the virus caused
disease or damage in its host.

Li took an unusual approach to investigate the virus mutation She analysed the viral strains isolated
from 11 randomly chosen Covid-lQ patients from Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang, and
then tested how efficiently they could infect and kill cells.

The deadliest mutations in the Zhejiang patients had also been found in most patients across Europe,
while the milder strains were the predominant varieties found in parts of the United States, such as
Washington state, according to their paper.

A separate study had found that New York strains had been imported from Europe. The death rate in
New Vork was similar to that in many European countries, if not worse.

But the weaker mutation did not mean a lower risk for everybody, according to Li‘s study. In Zhejiang,
two patients in their 305 and 505 who contracted the weaker strain became severely ill. Although both
survived in the end, the elder patient needed treatment in an intensive care unit.

This finding could shed light on differences in regional mortality. The pandemic's infection and death
rates vary from one country to another, and many explanations have been proposed.

Genetic scientists had noticed that the dominant strains in different geographic regions were inherently
different. Some researchers suspected the varying mortality rates could. in part. be caused by mutations
but they had no direct proof.

The issue was furthercomplicated because survival rates depended on many factors, such as age,
underlying health conditions or even blood type

In hospitals, Covid-19 has been treated as one disease and patients have received the same treatment
regardless ofthe strain they have. Li and her colleagues suggested that defining mutations in a region
might determine actions to fight the virus,

“Drug and vaccine development, while urgent, need to take the impact of these accumulating mutations
into account to avoid potential pitfalls,“ they said.

NIH Production to ICAN_002507

Li was the first scientist to propose the Wuhan lockdown according to state media reports. The
government followed her advice and in late January, the city of more than 11 million residents was shut
down overnight

The sample size in this most recent study was remarkably small, Other studies tracking the virus
mutation usually involved hundreds, or even thousands, ofstrains.

Li’s team detected more than 30 mutations. Among them 19 mutations — or about 60 per cent — were
new.

They found some of these mutations could lead to functional changes in the virus’ spike protein, a
unique structure over the viral envelope enabling the coronavirus to bind with human cells. Computer
simulation predicted that these mutations would increase its infectivity.

To verify the theory, Li and colleagues infected cells with strains carrying different mutations. The most
aggressive strains could generate 270 times as much viral load as the weakest type. These strains also
killed the cells the fastest.

It was an unexpected result from fewer than a dozen patients, ”indicating that the true diversity of the
viral strains is still largely underappreciated,” Ll wrote in the paper.

‘L-ﬂ

The mutations were genes different from the earliest strain isolated in Wuhan, where the virus was first
detected in late December last year.

The coronavirus changes at an average speed of about one mutation per month. By Monday, more than
10,000 strains had been sequenced by scientists around the globe, containing more than 4,300
mutations, according to the China National Centre for Bioinformation.

Most of these samples, though, were sequenced by a standard approach that could generate a result
quickly. The genes were readjust once, for instance, and there was room for mistakes.

Li’s team used a more sophisticated method known as ultra-deep sequencing. Each building block of the
virus genome was read more than 100 times, allowing the researchers to see changes that could have
been overlooked by the conventional approach.

The researchers also found three consecutive changes — known as tri-nucleotide mutations — in a 60—
year-old patient, which was a rare event. Usually the genes mutated at one site at a time. This patient
spent more than 50 days in hospital, much longer than other Covid-IE patients, and even his faeces
were infectious with living viral strains.

NIH Production to ICAN_002508

“lnvestigating the functional impact of this tri-nucleotide mutation would be highly interesting,” Li and
colleagues said in the paper.

Professor Zhang Xuegong, head of the bioinformatics division at the National Laboratory for lnformation
Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, said ultra-deep sequencing could be an effective
strategy to track the virus’ mutation.

“lt can produce some useful information,” he said.

But this approach could be much more time consuming and costly. It was unlikely to be applied to all
samples.

"Our understanding ofthe virus remains quite shallow,” Zhang said. Questions such as where the virus
came from, why it could kill some healthy young people while generating no detectable symptoms in
many others still left scientists scratching their heads,

”lfthere is a discovery that overturns the prevailing perception, don’t be surprised."

Dear Dr. Fauci,

| just wanted to say thank you for everything you are doing to educate us in this
country, and keep us safe during this horrendous coronavirus pandemic. Ican't
even begin to imagine how difficult it is to maintain your composure and
persevere with your focus, being constantly in the public eye and also trying to
expertly guide a president who seems more preoccupied with his own image (and
sound of his own voice), and political aspirations than with the actual well being
of his countw‘s citizens.

By now, it should be perfectly clear to us that we can’t have a healthy economy
withouta health 0 ulation.

— We a“ have been

diiigeni about staying at home—
— ordering food and other things to be delivered to our
house (we all wash our hands ‘religiously‘). - is the only one of us

who occasionally goes to a grocery store or drug store if necessary and then, he
always wears a mask, gloves, and keeps at least six feet between himself and
anyone else, and gets in and out as quickly as possible. In addition, _
_ are so intent on keeping me well and alive, we haven‘t even, any of us,
physically visited with each other, in person, inside our house for months.

    

NIH Production to ICAN_002513

In the past two months, I’ve been outside only four times —twice on our deck and
twice in my car, dropping off a couple of shopping bags at a friend’s house and at
— group home - both times leaving the bags in the driveway,
and then driving right back home.

I'm so thankful for FaceTime, but we miss hugs and kisses. I know all this must
sound extreme, and it is, but I’m terrified of becoming a statistic so we’re doing
whatever we can to stay healthy for ourselves and one another.

  

— My family is hearing what you’re saying and taking your advice.
I’m sorry this email is so long but my intention, more than anything, is to thank
you for your wisdom and advice, both grounded in years of experience.

I worked at NIH for about 25 years — in the CC, in MCI, and in Human Genome. I
met you once, briefly, about 40 years ago (+/-) in Bldg. 31’s fitness room. I had
been working in the CC, in the Patient Activities Dep’t. (on the PCB out- and in-
patient units)at the time. I was incorrectly using a piece of equipment and you
were kind enough to come over and show me the correct way to use it. I
recognized you immediately, and have never forgotten that experience and how
gracious you were.

I’m well aware from the news that you are up against some very tough people
and some very tough times but please know you also have an army of grateful
followers in this country who are completely convinced that what you are
advising is in their very best interest.

Thank you again for all you‘ve done for all of us over the years. My family and I
are more grateful than I can express.

PSI read all about your wife who sounds amazing also. You two make an "All-
Star” team.

Be well.

Gratefully, Joan ("Joanie") Hussey

Subject: Thank you

Dear Dr. Fauci,

| just wanted to say thank you for everything you are doing to educate us in this
country, and keep us safe during this horrendous coronavirus pandemic. Ican’t
even begin to imagine how difficult it is to maintain your composure and
persevere with your focus, being constantly in the public eye and also trying to
expertly guide a president who seems more preoccupied with his own image (and
sound of his own voice), and political aspirations than with the actual well being
of his country’s citizens.

By now, it should be perfectly clear to us that we can’t have a healthy economy
without a healthy population.

. We all have been

diligent about staying at home—
—, ordering food and other things to be delivered to our
house (we all wash our hands 'religiously’). - is the only one of us
who occasionally goes to a grocery store or drug store if necessary and then, he
always wears a mask, gloves, and keeps at least six feet between himself and
anyone else, and gets in and out as quickly as possible. In addition, -
- are so intent on keeping me well and alive, we haven’t even, any of us,
physically visited with each other, in person, inside our house for months.

In the past two months, I've been outside only four times — twice on our deck and
twice in my car, dropping off a couple of shopping bags at a friend’s house and at
— - both times leaving the bags in the driveway,
and than driving right back home.

I'm so thankful for FaceTime, but we miss hugs and kisses. I know all this must
sound extreme, and it is, but I’m terrified of becoming a statistic so we’re doing

  
  

 

— My family is hearing what you're saying and taking your advice.
I'm sorry this email is so long but my intention, more than anything. is to thank
you for your wisdom and advice, both grounded in years of experience.

I worked at NIH for about 25 years — in the CC, in NCI, and in Human Genome. I
met you once, briefly, about 40 years ago (+/-) in Bldg. 31’s fitness room. I had
been working in the CC, in the Patient Activities Dep't. (on the PCB out— and in—
patient units)at the time. I was incorrectly using a piece of equipment and you
were kind enough to come over and show me the correct way to use it. I
recognized you immediately, and have never forgotten that experience and how
gracious you were.

 

I‘m well aware from the news that you are up against some very tough people
and some very tough times but please know you also have an army of grateful
followers in this country who are completely convinced that what you are
advising is in their very best interest.

Thank you again for all you’ve done for all of us over the years. My family and I
are more grateful than I can express.

PSI read all about your wife who sounds amazing also. You two make an ”All-
Star“ team.

Be well.

Gratefully, loan (“Joanie") Hussey

Dear Tony:

Thank you for all you are doing. Not sure you remember me (5)“)

we talked a lot when I was at CNN. 1 have not
wanted to bother you but wanted to make sure you had the National Testing Action Plan that we
have put together with top researchers from all the various roadmaps, etc, I joined The
Rockefeller Foundation after working in Afghanistan and Pakistan with State and coerced
Christy Feig to join me We would be happy to get on a call today with Raj and Jonathan Quick
and other authors like Mike Pellini and Mark McLellan and Rick Klausnert

Given our history with public health and our ability to convene, we hoped we could help by

working out a consensus plan. I haw been brieﬁng Caleb McCarry at the White House. We
have worked with industry to also ﬁgure out the solutions to the supply chain issues and the

other logistical issues, We are going to put 3 10 million into helping this standupi This plan
doesn't just say what we need but the steps to get it done to open more safely.

Subject: ASF: Today's VES Network interview

You have an interview today with Jack Curry of the YES Network (Yankees). Just last night, The
NY Post ran a story that includes Jack among the many sports broadcasting stars that have
come out of Fordham (“Quack and I have

talked about this). Thought you might like to see it, Parts of your interview are also going to
run on Michael Kay’s show, and Kay also features prominently in this piece.

How Fordham has produced a generation of
sports media stars

Long before he was an electee to the Basketball Hall of Fame, Mike Breen was an intimidated

lseyeareold freshman attending a workshop at Fordham‘s renowned college radio station,
WFUV, in the fall of 1979.

Breen felt sheepish next to the juniors and seniors leading the seminar and contemplated
delaying the start ofhis broadcasting training. Soon, a couple of upperclassmen, including future
NBA writer Dave D’Alesandro, made him feel more comfortable.

But he still didn’t have any friends until one day on campus he saw a conﬁdent sophomore trying
to sweet talk a young woman. "I know you like me,” he said. “I can see it in your eyes.“

The woman responded by saying she would not date him ifhe were the last man on earth. She
essentially was saying, “See ya" to Michael Kay.

That is how Breen first became friends with Kay.

“For him to have the conﬁdence to do this in front of everybody with this beautiful student. I
thought, ‘Man. this guy has a great sense of humor,” Breen said.

Four decades later, Breen and Kay are still good friends

Fordham, the private J esuit university in The Bronx that launched the legendary Vin Scully, for
decades has been a powerhouse sportscasting pipeline, especially in New York. And the school
ties that ﬁrst united Breen and Kay are webbed throughout the industry.

Fordham is the alma mater for the voice ofthe NBA Finals/Knicks (Breen, Class of 1983), the
Yankees’ lead TV play-by-player/ESPN New York aﬁemoon radio host (Kay, ’82), the voice of
the Giants (Bob Papa, ’86). the radio Voice ofthc Nets (Chris Carlino, ’92) MSG’s John
Giannone (’86), YES' Jack Curry (’86), WFAN’s Paul Dollino (’86) and YES/ESPN’S Ryan
Ruocco (’08). And that’sjust New York-based sportscastersr

For good measure, the school produced CBS’ Spero Dedes (’01), ESPN‘s Tony Reali (’00) and
the Washington Nationals’ Charlie Slowes (’83). There are many more, and not just in front of
the camera If you need a ﬁeld producer, Jim Johnson (’86) works for ESPN. A radio engineer?
WFAN‘s Chris Majkowski (’89) will set things up. Media relations? Louis Barricelli (’09) is
leading things at MLB Network.

Like everyone else, they are all dealing with the halt of sports due to the coronavirus pandemic,
it is a jarring timeout for people so used to being on the run,

Take Carrino, who has done so much to raise money and awareness for facio scapulo humeral
dystrophy (FSHD), a form of muscular dystrophy that afﬂicts him, A ﬁmdraising event was
supposed to take place in March at a Nets game at Barclays Center. IIis 10th annual fundraising
dinner, corresponding with his 50th birthday, was slated for August, and now is in question.

“I don’t know if it is going to be safe to have people together still," Carrino said, “Are the
restrictions going to be there in terms of how many people can gather in one place? The other
aspect of it for me is: How comfortable am I asking people for money when I know the economy
and certain businesses are affected so badly?"

Ruocco was supposed to get married in Italy in June. He and his ﬁancee, Andrea Ferzoco, are
now going to punt the wedding until June 2021.

“It sucks," Ruocco said. “Andrea and I were so excited and so were our guests. We have been
feeling all the joy leading us to this. There are people dealing with much more dire
circumstances than rescheduling a wedding. That is kind of the perspective we have tried to
take."

While most of the successful sports media alumni are worried about the current direction of
Fordham and WFUV because ofa dc-cmphasis on sports during the pandemic, to a man they say
how Fordham molded them and led them lo where they are today.

They were helped by famous names such as the legendary Marty Glickman, a mentor, and Stan
Fischler, who taught classes. Then there were the less famous, equally instrumental ﬁgures in the
program, such as Bob Ahrens, who ran WFUV as its executive producer during many ofthese
notable students’ formative years.

John Giannone puming at FordhamCourtesv ofJohn Giannone

The experiences that they shared forged many of them, such as Breen and Kay, into close
friends.

Giannone went to Fordham aﬁer being recruited to be a punter on the football team. During
training camp his freshman year, he quickly ﬁgured out the third-string punter would never see
the ﬁeld. He went to Kay, then the WhUV sports director as a senior, to try to help on the station.
Kay said Giannone could do stats for him during the football season,

Kay went on to work at The Post, and later helped Giannone land an entry-level position at the
paper. When Giannone transferred into television at CNN/Sports Illustrated, it was through a
Kay connection. And Giannone landed at MSG Network after Kay left to become the TV voice
of the Yankees when YES Network began.

When it was Giannane's turn as WFUV sports director, he made Papa and Curry a play-by-
player and an analyst when they were sophomores.

WP U V also got its staff access to locker rooms at places like Yankee Stadium and Madison
Square Garden to leam the eraﬁ next to professionals at the highest level. That remains largely
true today.

“WFUV allowed you to believe you were a professional broadcaster bcforc you really were,”
Curry said. “We were in Lhe heart of New York City, and, even ifwe weren‘t Marv Albert, we
felt as if what Marv Albert was doing for the Knicks, we were doing for Fordham.”

There is a lineage that unites. Carrino learned how to describe the geography of a basketball
court from Glickman. Later, Catrina retumed to Fordham and taught Ruoeeo the same lessons.
These days, at some Nets games, Rnoeeo is on TV, sitting next to Carrino, calling the game on
the radio,

NIH Production to ICAN_002535

 

Jack Currv Courtesy olJack Curry

Papa also was mentored by Glickman. Papa and Canino each were told by their fathers that if
they majored in communications, they would have to pay for school themselves. Both ended up
in the Business School, but had their eyes on WFUV the whole time

Canino ended up working as a producer for Papa. beginning when Papa hosted a tailgate show
on WFAN Carrino eventually followed Papa as the radio voice of the Nets

The Fordham sports alums want everyone to be safe during this time — and they can’t wait to
get back to what they love to do,

“I'm desperate to get back to work," Breen said, “I‘m hoping there is NBA basketball. This is the
best time of the year.”

Subject: the Strategy document

Here is the working draft of the article forthe NEJM 1 It. in my opinion, reads really well . I have
embellished it today with a figure that conceptually outlines what we are talking about; the old
axiom that a picture is worth a thousand words .

The editorial guidelines of the NEJM has 2potentia|categories, One is Perspectives which is 1200
words an 5 references . We are at 1750 words and lthink losing 500 words takes awaya lot
from the message .The other category is a special report which is over 2500 words and allows lots
of references ( 40)| think this is best and was one reason I thought about adding the conceptual
figure which does outline ina single picture whatwe are talking about .

Tony, Ifyou feel its best to have Francis on this paper we both support it. Your call . I do however
lean on including Francis .lwould say politlcly to achieve our goal and bring all these companies
into the tent while you are away at the White House having him buy into this plan through the
ACTIV program seems important to us . lthink we get to our goal if he is outthere publicly embracing
this; using the NIAID networks labs DSMB and the correlates programs .This type ofgranularity
really puts him deep into understanding what we are doing . If this means you are first and he is
last author we are ok withthat, For mel need to have him use me for interfacing with the
company in defining these collaborations . If you were present all the time this would be
unnecessary , but as he will be the link with BARDA linking hlm to John and l increases the
likelihood of success.

Dear David et at,

Thanks for forwarding this very thoughtful document, which presents a series of
important recommendations — most of which I agree with. Idon't know if you saw
Friday’s announcement (attached) of the new public private partnership called
ACTlV (for Accelerating COVID-lB Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines), but it
has taken on most of the points you raise in sections 1—3 of your letter. | share
your hopes that remdesivir will show benefit, and the current large NIH-sponsored
RCT has completed enrollment and should reveal results in about a month. But of
course we want to test multiple other interventions — both small molecules and
antibody-based therapies, so we need ourtrial system to be optimized like never
before. I will share your letter with the leaders of ACTlV, who are working with
unprecedented speed to prioritize the next set oftherapeutic candidates as well as
pushing vaccine development programs to adopt exceptionally creative trial
designs to test safety and efficacy (with full engagement by FDA).

Dear Francis,

I hope you are well,

lwrite on behalf of a group of citizen—scientists, most or all of whom you know. Motivated
solely by our desire to help defeat the serious threat our nation and the world now faces,
we wrote a set of four actionable, non~partisan proposals (attached) to produce safe and
effective COVID-19 therapeuticsand vaccines in the shortest possible timeframe, and to

reopen our society in a manner that reduces the risk of future COV|D~19 outbreaks.

We hope you find these ideas interesting, and might be willing to share this set of
proposals with Dr. Tony Fauci, a orig with our willingness to discuss any part of the

NIH Production to ICAN_002546

proposals with him ifwe can be helpful. We understand from our efforts to contact Dr.
Fauci through email routes that his standard inbox may be too overwhelmed tor our
proposal to reach him.

The four proposals attached describe (1) How to rapidly repurpose an antiviral drug to
treat COVID-19 patients: (2) How to expedite the development of human antibody drugs to
treat patients and to provide short-term protection for healthy individuals; (3) How to
develop COVIDeIQ vaccines on an expedited time scale; and (4) How to reopen our
businesses and schools in a mariner that reduces the risk of future outbreaks and deaths

Thank you for any help or thoughts you might be able to prOVlde,

Sincerely yours,

Annual Meeting panel on COVID-19 is less than a week away and my team needs answers to the
questions below. Can you call this to his attention or assist him in providing the signed form and
requested information? We hope to have this by Tuesday (4/23l morning, if possible.

0 Please provide a cell number where you can be reached in case you do not connect in time (if
you prefer, you can provide the number of your assistant if they will be able to reach you
directly by cell or at home).

0 Will you have slides to display during yourtalk?

- Are you able to use Zoom lshare your screen’ to show the slides directly during your talk or do
you need someone from NAS to show your slides foryou?

0 Will you need a test session with our Zoom techs? Please let me know as soon as possible as
staff are available to hold training sessions through Monday, April 20 (9 AM to 5 PM EDTl.

- If you would like to promote your participation in our meeting on social media, please let me
know the contact of your social media contact from your institution.

Finally, because this isgoing to be a remote meeting, we would like panelists to log into Zoom 30
minutes before the session starts— that is at 1:30 pm ET to go over the technology and any last minute
speaker prep. So far, more than 800 Academy members have registered for the meeting and there will
be additional members of the public and possibly the press tuning in.

night, I just wanted to say a personal thankyau on behalf of ourstaff and collaborators, for publicly
standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-
human spillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

 

From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel
the myths being spun around the virus’ origins.

Once this pandemic’s over I look forward thanking you in person and let you know how important your

Coronavirus (COVlD-19) Update: FDA, Gates
Foundation, UnitedHeaIth Group, Quantigen,
and U.S. Cotton Collaborate to Address
Testing Supply Needs

 

 

NIH Production to ICAN_002556

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a further expansion of COVID-19 testing options
through the recognition that spun synthetic swabs—with a design similar to Q—tips — could be used to
test patients by collecting a sample from the front of the nose.

As part of this effort, U.S. Cotton, the largest manufacturer of cotton swabs and a subsidiary of
Parkdale-Mills, developed a polyester-based Q»tip»type swab that is fully synthetic forcompatibility
with COVID-19 testing. Harnessing its large-scale U.S.»based manufacturing capabilities, U.S. Cotton
plans to produce these new polyester swabs in large quantities to help meet the needs for
coronavirus diagnostic testing.

”This action today demonstrates the ingenuity that results from the FDA working in partnership with
the private sector. TheTrump Administration has been working side-bv-side With our Industry
partners to fight this pandemic, and today is a great example of that works We appreciate work by
UnitedHealth Group. Quantigen, and the Gates Foundation to perform and support the clinical
studies necessary for this advancement. We also want to acknowledge U.S. Cotton’s efforts to
manufacture a new type of swab for COVlD-19 testing that can be produced at scale. We appreciate
the work of these collaborators to consider how these test supplies could be broadly distributed to
meet not only the testing needs of the United States but also global needs around the pandemic. All
of these actions by these American organizations will help continue to expand our testing capability,”
said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, MD.

This finding that spun synthetic swabs could be used for COVID~19 testing is based on results from a
clinical investigation that representsa collaboration between the FDA, UnitedHealth Group, the Gates
Foundation, and Qua ntigen. The type of testing at the front of the nose used in this study is notable
because it allows self~collection by patients thereby limiting exposure of healthcare providers; it is
more comfortable for patients and it can be performed bya swab that is more readily available and
manufacturable at scale.

It would be run across all oftheir sociai media platforms (reach of over 1M). They would also air clips on

“I think the time has come, with our models on 260 counties across the country releasing in the
next 48 hours, to offer Tony F auct, and potentially other task force members, a preview of the
work. Our models have incorporated local area differences due to weather, population and social
distancing. They reveal that the large, densely populated cities will struggle to reopen. and are
not well aided by weather effects given their densityl However, in less densely populated areas,
in which case counts are lower, weather has been a mitigating factor. These latter counties may

Importance: High

Dear Dr. Fauci,
dear Dr. Coomes.

thank you for your reply from 13. April with the notice that the information has been shared with NiAlD’s
COVID719 research team.

Has the project already been initially evaluated by the team?
Are there any questions or need for additional information?

o l have summed up the relevant data regarding the use of proteasome inhibitors for treatment of
COVlDrl9 patients with acute lung and systemic organ failure in a position paper. please find a
Preview draft attached.

C With regard to currently ongoing trials with monoclonal antibodies against the |L-6 receptor, i.e.
tocilizumab or sarilumab: These approaches go into the same direction as the present
suggestion, however. inhibition of NF-KB by proteasome inhibitors could prowde the unique
potential to inhibit the release of multiple cytokines simultaneously, in particular strongly pro»
inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL»6, TNFu and chemokines, such as MIP»1 and CXCLI

- This simultaneous inhibition ofmultiple cytokines/chemokine seems to be advantageaus
compared to single target approaches (as with the mAb) to compensate for redundant and
synergistic effects of multiple cytokines released during highly pathogenic CoV or H5N1
infection

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Subiect: WG: Inhibit cytokine storm in COVlD-19 patients by Velcade Bortezomib
Importance: High

Inhibition of cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrom by
PROTEASOME INHIBITORS e.g. Velcade (Bortezomib)

Dear Dr. Fauci,

dear Madams/Sirs,

Iwa nt to bring to your attension some potentially important experimental data and a new proposal for
treatment of COVlD-19 patients with atute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure. Sorry for
the broad distribution but I wanted to make sure that my message reaches you.

Similarly as has been described earlier for SARS-COV. MERS—CoV (Cliannappanavar & Perlman.
2017), H5N1 and some heavy HlNl Inﬂuenza A infections, also COVlDJQ patients have been
reported to show significantly increased systemic cytokine release (i.e. cytokine storm), particularly
those patients with lung failure or systemic organ failure (Chuoli'n Huang et ul. Lancet vol 395, 2020, re]
1).

Previous studies at Virologik GmbH, Erlangen, Germany, in colaboration with the Friedrich-Laeffler-
lnstitut, Tuebingeny Germany have shown. that H5N1 (or alternatively LPSI -induced Cytokine storm in
viva can be inhibited by application of Proteasome Inhibitors (E. Haasbach et al, Antiviral Res. 91,
2011, ref. 2], via the inhibition of translocation of the NF-KB transcr tion factor to the nucleus (see
Fig. below). The mechanism OfNF‘KB inhibition by proteasome inhibitors is well described, and works
via the inhibition ofthe proteasomal degradation of the cytosolic inhibitor lKE, this way keeping NF-KB
bound in the cytosol and thereby inhibiting the otherwise induced (by cytokine or LPS or RNA virus]
translocation of NF-KB to the nucleus where it would initiate the transcription of many cytokines. This
effect of proteasome inhibitors seems to work in most cell types, we could demonstrate this effect in
several different cell types (including macrophages) after stimulation with TNFa in vitro and in H5N1 (or
LPS) treated mice in vivo (see manuscript and Figs. attached].

Inhibition of NF-KB by proteasome inhibitors provides the unique potential to inhibit the release of
many cytokines simultaneously, in particular strongly proinflammatory cytokines lL-la. IL-6, TNFoL, MIP-
113...) (whereas some other cytokines involved in antiviral immune response, such as IFNy probably seem
to be not/less affected (because of different transcription pathway).

NIH Production to ICAN_002584

Importantly, beside the anti-inflammatory activity, proteasome inhibitors showed also significant anti-
fibrotic activity (Lueftenegger et al., manuscript and figs attached), which may be also important in the
treatment of COVID»19 patients with heavy lung disease.

Furthermore, there have been several publications showing that in particular early phases of the
replication cycle of Corona virus seemto be dependent on interaction with the ubiquitin-proteasomal
system (UPS) of the host cell, and were effectively inhibited by selective 20$ proteasome inhibitors
(such as Velcadel (Wang et al. ViralagyJZDlD, 7199 (ref. 3); M. Reuben et al. J. Virology, 84(15), 2010,
ref. 4).

There are several registered proteasome inhibitors (Burtezomib (Velcadeel e.g. produced by
Millennium Pharmaceuticals (ie Takeda Oncology); Carfilzomib (Kyprolis‘i’), lxazomib [Ninlaro”)) for
treatment of multiple myeloma and Mantel cell lymphoma, ie. there are registered drugs with well
known side effects available to be tested in small clinical studies for evaluation of their therapeutic
efficacy in COVlD-19 patients with heavy lung disease and otherorgan failure, Noteworthy. in contrast
to the chronical oncological indicationswhere up to 8 treatment cycles (and sometimes even more) are
applied, it seems plausible thatjust one ortwo treatment cycles of proteasome inhibitors might be
sufficient to downregulate the cytokine storm in COVlD-lg patients, which would be associated also
with much lower side effects.

Early first experience on efficacy could be gained from compassionate use applications in heavily i|l
COVlDalS patients very quickly. Beside the registered application forms , i.e. infusions, probably also
inhalative application should be tested as well, because it may be bettersuited to reach the respective
target cells in the lung, i.e. alveolar epithelial cell and alveolar macrophages. There are multiple
inhalative devices available, e.g. the Handyhaler by Boehringer Ingelheim used for Spiriva (for COPD
treatment),

Although there are still many open questions, the potential to control the cytokine storm-induced heavy
lung and other organ failure by using already registered drugs, ie. proteasome inhibitors may be a real
chance to get an additional treatment option, hopefully decreasing the cases necessary for artificial

aeration.

Please forward this mail to the colleages you consider relevant for evaluation, discussion and
consideration for your clinical strategy for COVID~19.

Please let me know if additional information: are necessary,

Abstract

The appearance ofhighly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses of the H5N1 subtype being able to
infect humans and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic reveals the urgent need for new and efficient
countermeasures against these viruses, The long-term efﬁcacy of current antivirals is often limited,
because of the emergence of drug-resistant virus mutants. A growing understanding of the virus-host
interaction raises the possibility to explore alternative targets involved in the viral replication. In the
present studywe show that the proteasome inhibitor VL-O1 leads to reduction of inﬂuenza virus
replication in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) as demonstrated with three
different inﬂuenza virus strains. A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1 N1 ) (E050 value of 1.7 pM),
A/Regensburg/D6/09 (H1N1v) (EC50 value of 2.4 pM) and A/Mallard/Bavaria/1/2006 (H5N1) (E050
value of 048 uM), In in vivo experiments we could demonstrate that VL—01-aerosol-treatment of
BALB/c mice with 14.1 mg/kg results in no toxic side effects, reduced progeny virus titers in the lung
(1.1 t 0.3 log10 pfu) and enhanced survival of mice after infection with a 5-fold MLDSD of the human
influenza A virus strain A/Puerto Ricol8/34 (H1N1) up to 50%. Furthermore, treatment of mice with

NIH Production to ICAN_002586

VL-01 reduced the cytoklne release of lL-alB. lL-6. MlP-1 B. RANTES and TNF—u induced by LPS or
highly pathogen avian H5N1 influenza Avirus. The preaent data demonstrates an antiviral effect of
VL-01 in vitro and in vlvo and the ability to reduce inﬂuenza virus induced cylokines and
chemokines.

Dear Tony,

1 have always felt reassured when the good Dr. Fauci speaks, and now more than ever. As
an American, a former colleague, a longtime admirer and student of your wisdom —thank
you. We are all safer because of you, and the world will be a better place because of you.
Again.

As you know, lam now leading the ONE Campaign. We’ve been quite active with the
ONEWorId Campaign, dedicated to the fight against this newest virus, and focused on
Africa. We’ve made some progress on debt, and next up is a focus on ensuring that a
vaccine, when it comes, is available to everyone.

One of the things we want to do is educate people, in all of the places we work. It won’t
surprise you that of particular urgency amongst our partners in Africa is that facts and
information get to people across the continent, but we also know that more facts are
needed everywhere. So next month we are going to launch #FassTheMic, where every day
for 19 days we will ask a celebrity to turn his or hersocial media channels overto an expert
on COVID»19 for one day. SoJuIia Roberts might turn her Twitter account to you to talk
about the critical elements neeced to flatten the curve and slow the spread. Or Idris Elba
could give up his lnstagram to the head of the African CDC so that he can illustrate the
impact COVID-19 will have across Africa and what that means for the rest ofthe world.

We know artists want to be helpful right now, but that it Is hard to know what to do. And
we know there are experts like you out there who have the answers. We've thought about
this a lot at ONE and wanted to do something we felt would truly have an impact. As we
lookahead we know COVID»19 does not know borders and until it is beaten everywhere
we are not in the clear. We need a global response plan and we need it now. By turning
overtheir platforms for the day, celebrity influencers will be donating one of their biggest
assets — their followers — to VOU, giving you the platform you need (and we all need) to tell
the world why a global response is critical. Because none of us are safe until all of us are
safe.

NIH Production to ICAN_002599

We will work with each expert/celebrity pair to personalize the content to our and our
celebrity partners’ audienceSe in North America, Europe and Africa, and help create
content that both parties are happy with. We are now confirming our talent partners, and
so far are getting a terrific response.

We know you're a busy man, so we've planned it so that the amount of time on your end
would be minimal. But the impact would be maximal.

I’m attaching more information about the campaign. Please let me know what you think
and if you have questions. Ideally we would like to get this off the ground in early May, so
are hoping to confirm folks by April 28th at the latest. Ourteam will be in touch with your
office to follow up.

Thanks as always for everything you do. All my best to you, Gayle

one of their biggest assets —thelrfollowers —to YOU, glvmg you the platform you need (and we all need)
to tell the world why a global responseis critical, Because none of us are safe until all of us are safe.

We will work with each expert/celebrity pair to personalize the content to our and our celebrity
partners' audiences — in North America, Europe and Africa, and help create content that both parties are

happy with We are now confirming our talent partners, and so far are getting a terrific response.

We know you‘re a busy man, so we’ve planned it so that the amount of time on your end would be
minimal. But the impactwould be maximal.

I'm attaching more information about the campaign. Please let me know what you thinkand if you have
questions. Ideally we would like to get this off the ground in early May, so are hoping to confirm folks by
April 28th at the latest. Ourteam will be in touch with your office to follow up.

Thanks as always for everything you do. All my best to you, Gayle

Dinah and Ned,

it was a pleasure talking to you about what you are considering. As we discussed, here is the NlAlD Strategic Plan
that was just published, and two models of funding opportunity announcements for you to consider as models. I also
think the Cancer Centers have aspects of collaboration, shared facilities, and research focus that you can borrow. So
much of what NIAID has built is modeled on the Cancer Centers,

Subject: RE : Interview

Hi Jennifer et al: Here are a few questions for Dr. Fauci.
Scientists from the University of Bristol found that the

coronavirus has unexpected tendency to large mutations in the
spike protein when its grown in monkey cells. This had been seen

NIH Production to ICAN_002619

before as a virus that was unwilling to mutate. Does this create
any concerns about vaccine design and effectiveness?

It now appears that some people who recover from Covid have no
antibodies to the SARS—CovZ. What are the possible explanations
for this? Has it occurred in other viral diseases? Does it have
any implications for the effectiveness of vaccines? Is NIAID
investigating this? Is there a possibility that the virus
sequesters in cells?

Another feature of coronaviruses appears to be rapidly waning
immunity. Has this been seen in any NIAID experiments? What does
this suggest about the virus's ability to evade the immune
system?

A laboratory at Oxford has suggested that, if all goes welL
they may be finished with phase 3 trials in 5000 people by the
fall, which could mean as early as September. Does that sound
realistic to you?

Some companies are asking regulators to make sure that safety
standards are upheld for makers of Covid vaccines, and that
corners aren't cut. Is it worth cutting some safety corners to
get a Covid vaccine ready for distribution?

How many people should the Moderna vaccine be tested in in phase
3? How long would you expect those trials to take?

Thanks very much, hope we can set this up soon. All best, JL +44

Dear Ms. Patricia Conrad

NIH Production to ICAN_002622

Dear Ms, Kimberly Marie Barasch

I hope you are well despite the current devastating world pandemic.

The Bolivian Society of intensive Care together with the Bolivian Healthcare
Ministry are writing the national guidelines for the management of COVlD-19 in the
critically ill patient. an issue that is an emergency worldwide and may

become disastrous in the low-middle income countries of Latin America if not
managed since the beginning with precise, accurate and uniform approaches.
With our team in Erasme University Hospital in Brussels, Belgium, together with
Professors Jean - Louis Vincent, Fabio Taccone, Jean Charles Preiser,
Jacques Creteur, etc., we are preparing the material with other Bolivian and
Mexican intensivists, internists, infectologists, imagenologlsts.

I wonder if Dr. Anthony Fauci would honor us coauthoring and reviewing our last
version of some chapters of our guidelines.

Dear Tony,

we are all witnessing the great effort your collaborators and yourself are investing over this pandemic
emergency.

As you well know, in Europe and Italy we had the unfortunate privilege of having been ﬁrst hit hard by
the pandemic, after China

We had the opportunity of meta-analyzing data from 170000 patients in European countries, for
associated determinants of the spreading force of COVlD»19.

If this may provide a useful, albeit non gratifying, contribution for the US and other countries. we would
feel we had done ourjob.

Subject: Covid 19 Double Mechanism. By Dr Brogna Carlo

Dear Dr A. Faucy,

we don't know each other. I was born (”(5) I am a simple doctor in
Medicin and live in a remote Italian region. I am no one. I trust in God that you can read my
paper, being published, I send it to you to anticipate the exit times because I trust that we can
really understand what Covid 19 is. Being nobody, I did what nobody would have done. I used
the few tools I had available and questioned all the papers and data published so far. I describe
what the dual mechanism of the Covid-l 9 can be. I anticipate that the result conclusioni is not
to my credit but I have been helped, I wish you a good read. May God bless us.

Subiect: impact of baricitinib in COVID—leen off label study CONFlDENTIAL
dear dr Fauci, good morning. I hope you are fine.
Apologies to disturb you but it may be of your interest. I saw in the web that you (NIAID/Fauci)(

https: investor.li|ly.com newsrreleases/newsrreleaserdetails li|ly—beginsrclin‘icalrtest‘ingrtherapiesrcowdrml
will be support a trial using Baricitinib as part ofthe ACTI' trial...

 

| collaborated with Fabrizio Cantini (he reads in cc), a reumathologist of Prato to write a letter to J Infection
(pdf attached). He conducted an off- label study in patients with mild-moderate pneumonia with COVID-19
[lSp02) >92% at roomiair, and ratio arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen (PaOZ/FiOZ)
100-300 mmHg] to evaluate the impact of baritinib (tablet 4 mg/day) in terms of safety, clinical respiratory
improvements. discharge. ICU transfer in 2 weeks; these patients received also lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
The last consecutive patients With moderate COVlD-19 pneumonia receivmg standard of care therapy
(lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquinel admitted before the date of the first ba ricitinib-treated patient
served as controls.

NIH Production to ICAN_002629

The results of this off—label study, with the limit of not been a RCI', are encouraging:
1. Safety: only 1/12 case of transaminase elevation at day 10, likely due to Iopinavirritonavir coA
administration because baricitinib is mainly renal secreted
2. Respiratory improvement: SpOZ and ratio arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen
(PaOZ/FiOZ) significantly improved;
3. Discharge in 7/12 V: 1/12
4. ICU transfer (0/12 vs 4/12)

I do hope it may be a useful, although lam aware that it is a very preliminary info for you.
Thank you for your attention.

All the best

Subiect: all my gratitude and an update

dear dr Fauci, apologies to write you inthese busy days. It is only to express all my gratitude for what
you have done in your life to fight infectious diseases and what you are doing now for COVID-19.
Your efforts and achievement are in front of the whole world and for me it is a great honor to have
been with you in 1992-1996 at the time of HlV ﬁght. As I told you many times, you are a model of
excellence'

Only to keep you updated in my life, I am ﬁne, and I mainly work as an ID specialist and scientist at
the same place in Rome, the National Institute for Infectious Diseases L. Spallanzani. I am doing 2
days a week outpatients TB cl' lo and I run a small laboratory on TB research. However, given the
pandemia, l shifted the lab activ as on COVID-19, in particular on:

1 the role of coinfection (COVlD-19 coinfection with tuberculosis, or COVlD-19
ooinfectlon with HIV) on the modulation of the in vitro immune speciﬁc-response to
SARS-CoV-Z, or M. tuberculosis or HIV in cells from COVlD-19 patients at different
clinical stage

 

NIH Production to ICAN_002631

2 in vitro evaluation of the immunological and virological effect of baricinib, an anti-JAKi
and —JAK2 drugs, used in reumathoid arthritis, that has shown using BenevolentAl's
proprietary artificial intelligence-derived knowledge graph, as an agent that reduces the
SARS-CoV-Z endocytosis into target cells potentially inhibiting the entry.

Moreover, I would be happy to contribute in any activity you may think lam useful.
lwish you a happy Easter in this blessed day.

Thank you for your attention and for having had the possibility of working with you that has been
crucial in my personal and professional life.

All the best

EPA (https:I/www.cdc.nav/coronavirug/1019-ncav/communitv/reopen-
guidancehtml . Attached are two documents focused on re-opening America
with emphasis on cleaning and disinfection, including high»touch surfaces.
Also below are a number of websites that address cleaning and disinfection
which point out the importance of disinfecting high-touch locations like
doorknobs. They give guidance how to clean them, but they don’t address
methods for using a paper towel or Kleenex to first turn the knob and then

discard the towel. —

HI there,

Please see below. HHS is taking over the Partnership for Public Service IG account next week for Public
Service Recognition Week. They asked if Dr. Fauci would be willing to do a short (SO-second or less pre-
recorded video thanking public servants for their work. It would be featured during the takeover. and also
on NIH's other srn handles next week. It can be taken on a cell phone as srn does not require higher
resolution. Let me know if you would like to accept or decline the request.

Many ﬂianks.

OHR is taking over the Partnership for Public Service (PPS) lnstagram account during Public

Service Recognition Week (May 3-9, 2020). The OHR team has reached out about wanting to
develop a senior leader "mashup" video —perhaps including the DepSec. T

NIH Production to ICAN_002643

They asked about the feasibility of this req uestt They also inquired about perhaps Dru Fa uci and
the SG doing a rare-recorded video thanking public servants for their work,

I wanted to gather the troops so we can identify what all is being planned for this week of
recognition and provide 3 FCC for OHR if the request is feasible.

Happy to set up a call, ifthat is needed to discuss further.

Thank;
Jane“

Importance: High

Dear Jerome,

I hope you are well. Thank you for all you are doing to represent public health and our nation. It is very
comforting knowmg you are inforrningthe nations COVID-19 response.

I wanted to give you an update on called Sara Alert, the software program I am leading at MITRE. Sara
Alert is being provided free of any costs and deployed in state, tribal, and local health departments to
support public health in contact tracing and active monitoring of indiVIduals in Isolation and quarantine.
We are engaged with ASTHO, NACCHO, CSTE, and the application is hosted live on APHL’s AIMS
platform. Sara Alert officially launched on April 3 and is currently supporting multiple jurisdictions
including Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Danbury, CT, and the State of Arkansas, It is
also being rolled out in Washington, AriIona, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maine and Vermont. We are getting
ready to launch in additional jurisdictions overthe next couple of weeks.

We have recently responded to questions we were told came from the White House so i wanted to

make sure you have background materials. I imagine you are the person that the President and Vice
President would turn to for information. I am happy to arrange any briefing materials or demo that

would be helpful foryou to respond

As I mentioned previously, Sara Alert is a standards—based, open source tool that automatesthe process
of monitoring individuals exposed to or infected with COVID'19 (or anydisease, it‘s configurable) — and
will serve as an enduring national resource to contain discasc. Sara Alert is free for use by public health
organizations.

Best wishes to you. Stay healthy for all of us.

Paul

ABOUT SARA ALERT

In response to the COVlD-19 pandemic, the MITRE Corporation, a not-for-profit that works in the public
interest, developed Sara Alert, 3 standards-based, open source tool in partnership with national public
health organizations Sara Alert automates the process of monitoring individuals exposed to or infected
with f0VlD-19 (or any disease, it’s configurable) — and will serve as an enduring national resource to
contain disease. Sara Alert is free for use by public health organizations.

- Sara Alert allows public health officials to import and enroll individuals [or households) at risk of
developing or infected with COVID-19.
I Individuals enter their symptoms daily via web, text, email or phone, allowing public health
officials to focus on high risk and non reporting individuals.
I The web-based tuul enables inLreased efﬁciency in tracking cases, leading to earlier
containment of the Virus and reduction of burden on public health resources.
I Sara Alert is a national system and allows transferal of monitorees across jurisdictions for tighter
contact tracing.
Sara Alert launched on April 3 and is new supporting multiple jurisdictions.

Sublect: RE: Your query to Dr. Kadlec
Dear Francis,

It was a pleasure to hear from you, and yes, it has been a long time since we met or
even spoke. Moons ago I was set to write to you after reading your wonderful
book, but I ended up instead speaking with others about it, I should add at this
point that I did not quickly respond to your email ofa few days ago because I
simply missed it.

It is true that I strongly suggest that OPV be quickly (already it is not quickly)
brought forward for induction of a strong innate immune response to prevent or
markedly reduce SARS-CoV-Zinlection and/or severity until the field obtains a
proven safe and efﬁcacious vaccine producing a long lasting, adaptive immunity.
OPV is very safe (notably for OPV 1 and 3 as bOPV which we will use and
completely safe in a vaccinated population), simple, cheap, rather obvious, yet
unique among the massive number of vaccines many (maybe most) of which are
the same or at least if not exactly the same aiming at the same mechanism
(targeting the spike and searching for the putative correlate of neutralizing Abs.l.

OPV should work for a few months and possibly longer. Also it should be working
multiple times so i think could cover more than a few months, giving us time for a
proven vaccine of adaptive immunity, which might be very long lasting as is hoped.

In the main the WHO comments are correct. Of course we sought and have letters
of support from them as well as from many others. Though they are again
supportive in their notes to you, there is one item that surprises me. They add
that there was no clinical efﬁcacy results as yet. They know orcertainly should
know that there is plenty of clinical data for this concept with BCG. OPV, and live
Measles vaccine. Needless to say this is what turned me on during our regular
Global Virus Network (GVN)conference calls, (Incidentally GVN is an organization I
have thought of bringing to your attention. lthink you would find it impressive and
useful). i would be happy to share with you the clinical observations with OPV if
you wish.

NIH Production to ICAN_002649

i would like to take a small diversion, but I suspect you are aware of these things.
My colleagues and I respect the WHO because of its representation and because
we have colleagues/friends there as well. However, sometimes bureaucracy ofa
massive degree leads to inaction or even much worse—— political expediency. I won’t
bother you with details of these unless you ask, but I had such experiences with

HTLV»1 which we discovered in 1980 as the 1St human retrovirus and which cause
not only the highest incidence of cancer (% of infections) of any virus and other
fatal diseases as well but mainly in less developed countries (plus Japan) and again
with HIV in 1984. Behavior was not beneficial. Perhaps it will be of relevance in the
future because a few at WHO took a position to remove OPV (Sabin) in favor of IPV
(Salk) in their polio eradication scheme. It was a huge failure. As my FDA
collaborator, Konstantin Chumakov, says ”Blessed be Bill Gates" because he saved
OPV and saved the day and in so doing has produced a still better OPV.

There is indeed data also for BCG as well as live Measles though I know less ofthe
latter. BCG is less available, requires injection, harder to make, not as safe, and we
think unlikely to be as effective as OPV. Nonetheless, we favor its use too. The
mechanisms will be similar.

You asked whether monkey trials are planned. For several reasons definitely not ~—
though we are planning some monkey experiments, but not large enough for
”clinical” conclusions. The main reasons are: 1) cost; 2) that billions not thousands
or millions have received OPV safely and in our collective View (and we know the
studies pretty well) protection has been clinically shown; 3) In a pandemic we
wished to move quickly (so far we must say that has not been achieved). A typical
monkey vaccine study will take time, but 4) in this case it would be a huge amount
of lost time as monkeys require great doses of polio for infection and monkeys
have to be trained to drink their orange juice. it would be hard to imagine that such
studies would even give us useful information.

On a final digression Francis l have had 36 years of on/off experiences with
glycosylated spike proteins—their analyses immunologically and especially
regarding use in vaccines and developing neutralizing Abs. i believe it will be a
mistake to put most eggs in that basket. The risks: shortened antibody half life; 2)
protection NOT correlating with neutralizing Abs; 3) sometimes hazards from them.
Admittedly, they might work, but I trust and hope that not everything is going in
this bag. Ifyou Wish to discuss this again Iwill be available.

Finally, I hd no idea you were into vaccines or SARS—Z nor any part of ConD-19
disease, but I am very happy to learn this.

Thanks

Dear Bob,

It’s been quite a while since we've chatted. Bob Kadlec asked me to respond to
your query about the possible use ofOPV to activate innate immunity and provide
COVID-lS protection. Has this been tested in a non-human primate model? I note
the recommendation below that says a clinical trial is planned — can you tell me
more about that?

As you can imagine, we are all flat out on the vaccine development pathwayl
Francis

The use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) to prevent SARS-Covz (Polio Eradication
Campaign)

There is no evidence that oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) protects people against
infection with COVlD-19virus.

Aclinical trial addressing this question is planned in the USA, and WHO will
evaluate the evidence when it is available.

In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend OPV vaccination for the
prevention of COVID~19. WHO continues to recommend OPV as part of essential
immunization services to prevent poliomyelitis and as part of global polio
eradication efforts.

There are experimental signals from various studies overthe years that OPV has

non-specific effects on the immune system. These effects have not been well
characterized and their clinical relevance is unknown. Such nonspeciﬁc effects may

NIH Production to ICAN_002651

not be limited to OPV, as other live vaccines have also been associated with non-
specific protective effects (such as BCG vaccine against tuberculosis). Nonlive
vaccines in contrast do not seem to have the same effects.

The exact mechanism of non-specific protection induced by live vaccines needs to
be elucidated further. Clinical studies could begin immediately because the
vaccines in question are licensed and have an excellent safety record. Clinical trials
involving off-label use of various drugs licensed for other indications are currently
underway. The existing scientific rationale suggests that the same should be done
for OPV and other live vaccines. A study is currently being discussed with various
partners and vaccine manufacturers, including the US FDA, the outcomes of which
will be carefully assessed to determine potential use in the context of the Spread of
SARS-CDVZ until the time when specific vaccines and antiviral therapies are ready.

A panel ofU.S. physrcians, statisticians, and other experts has developed treatment guidelines
for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-l 9) These guidelines, intended for healthcaie providers,
are based on published and preliminary data and the clinical expertise of the panelists. many of
whom are frontline clinicians caring for patients during the rapidly evolving pandemic. The
guidelines are posted online (covidl9treatmentguidelines.nih.gov) and will be updated oﬁen as
new data are published in peer-reviewed scientific literature and other authoritative information

emerges

The guidelines consider two broad categories of therapies currently in use by healthcare
providers for COVID-19: antivirals, which may target the coronavirus directly, and host
modiﬁers and immune-based therapiesv which may inﬂuence the immune response to the virus or

target the virus.

The panel’s conclusions about treating COVID—l9 with various agents that fall into these two
classes of therapies are distilled in summary recommendations Subsequently. the document
provides background information about each agentisuch as clinical data about its use, ongoing
clinical trials, and known interactions with other drugsithat forms the basis for the

Recommendation. Tables brieﬂy outline the same information,

The guidelines also describe the evaluation and stratiﬁcation of patients based on their risk of
infection and severity of illness. Recommendations in this section address best practices for
managing patients at different stages of infection, for example:

I Outpatients who are either asymptomatic or who have mild to moderate symptoms and are self-
isolating

. Inpatients with severe illness or critical disease
Special considerations for pregnant women and for children who are infected are also included

A comprehensive section of the guidelines addresses a range ot‘eonsiderations for clinicians

caring for the most critically ill hospitalized patients. This section includes multiple

NIH Production to ICAN_002665

recommendations for patients needing critical care. including infection control procedures,

hemodynamic and ventilatory support, and drug therapy.

Finally. the guidelines include recommendations concerning the use ofconcomitant medications.
These incltide statins: corticosteroids: non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs: and certain dnigs

used to control hypertension. knowr. as ACE inhibitors and ARBs,

The treatment guidelines panel is co—chaired by Roy M. Gulick, M.D.. chief of the Infectious
Disease Division at Weill Medical Hospital ofComel] University. New York City; H. Clifford
Lane. MD., Clinical director ofthe National Institute ot‘Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
National Institutes of Health; and Henry Masur, M.D,. chief of the Critical Care Medicine
Department at the NIH Clinical Center. Members of the guidelines panel, appointed by the co,
chairs, were chosen based on their clinical experience and expertise in patient management,
translational and clinical science. and/or the development of treatment guidelines. They include
30 experts drawn from US. healthcare and academic organizations. federal agencies. and
professional societies.

Abstract

Background Addressing COVID-lS is a pressing health and social concern. To date, many epidemic
projections and policies addressirg COVID-lB have been designed Without seroprevalence data to
inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-Z in Santa
Clara County. Methods On 4/34/4, 2020, we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-Z using
a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a representative
sample of the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We report the prevalence of
antibodies to SARSrCoVVZ in a sample of 3,330 people, adjusting for zip code, sex, and race/ethnicity,
We also adjust for test performance characteristics using 3 different estimates: (i) the test
manufacturer's data, (ii) a sample of37 positive and 30 negative controls tested at Stanford, and (iii) a
combination of both. Results The unadjusted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-Cov-Z in Santa Clara
County was 1.5% (exact binomial 95C| 1.11-1.97%),and the population-weighted prevalence was 2.81%
(QSCI 2.211337%]. Underthe three scenarios fortest performance characteristics, the population
prevalence of COVlD-19 in Santa Clara ranged from 2.49% (95Cl 1.80-3.17%)to 4.16% (LES-570%).
These prevalence estimates represent a range between 48,000 and 81,000 people infected in Santa
Clara County by early April, 50-85-fold more than the number of confirmed cases. Conclusions The
population prevalence ofSARS-CoV-Z antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection is much
more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. Population prevalence estimates
can now be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections.

HI there,

Please see below, HHS is taking over the Partnership for Public Service IG account next week for Public
Service Recognition Week. They asked if Dr. Fauci would be willing to do a short 30-second or less pre
recorded video thanking public servants for their work, It would be featured during the takeover, and also
on NlH's other sm handles next week. It can be taken on a cell phone as sm does not require higher
resolution. Let me know if you would like to accept or decline the request.

Many thanks.

Hello All,
Hope everyone is holding up well!
OHR is taking over the Partnership for Public Service (PPS) lnstagram account during Public

Service Recognition Week (May 3-9, 2020). The OHR team has reached out about wanting to
develop a senior leader ”mashup" video —perhaps including the DepSec. T

NIH Production to ICAN_002695

They asked about the feasibility of this request. They also inquired about perhaps Dr. Fauci and
the SG doing a pre-recorded video thanking public servants for their work,

I wanted to gather the troops so we can identify what all is being planned for this week of
recognition and provide a POC for OHR if the request is feasible.

Happy to set up a call, ifthat is needed to discuss further,
Thanks,

Jane”

Please find attached for your review a draft press release to announce the launch of the ACTT 2
COVID-19 treatment trial (remdeswlr and barlcitinib). Below IS your draft quote:

“We now have solid data showing that remdesivir diminishes to a modest degree the
time to recovery for people hospitalized with COVID-l9,” said NIAID Director Anthony S,
Fauci, MD. “ACTT 2 will examine if adding an anti—inﬂammatory agent to the rcmdcsivir

regimen can provide additional beneﬁt for patients, including improving mortality outcomes.”

The trial may start enrollment tomorrow,

Spike mutation pipeline reveals the emergence of a more
transmissible form of SARS-CoV-z

Korber 31, Fischer WM], Gnanakaran S1, Voon H1, Theiler h, Abfalterer W1, Foley Bl, Giorgi EE],
Bhattacharya T1, Parker MDs, Partridge DGI, Evans CMA, de Silva Ties, on behalf of the Sheffield
COVlD-19 Genomics Group», LaBramhe CC:, and Monteﬁori DC:

Summary

We have developed an analysis pipeline to facilitate real-time mutation tracking in SARS-CoV—Z, focusing
initially on the Spike (S) protein because it mediates infection of human cells and is the target of most
vaccine strategies and antibody-based therapeutics. To date we have identified fourteen mutations in
Spike that are accumulating. Mutations are considered in a broader phylogenetic context,
geographically, and over time, to provide an early warning system to reveal mutations that may confer
selective advantages in transmission or resistance to interventions. Each one is evaluated for evidence
of positive selection, and the implications of the mutation are explored through stmctural modeling. The
mutation Spike D6146 is of urgent concern; it bepn spreading in Europe in early February, and what
introduced to new regions it rapidly becomes the dominant form. Also, we present evidence of
recombination between locally circulating strains, indicative of multiple strain infections. These finding
have important implications for SARS-CoV-Z transmission, pathogenesis and immune interventions.

I thought you should know that the D6146 story is getting a lot of press attention today. | story came
out in the LA Times this morning that probably started it all. It will likely be on CNN tonight, and maybe

HI Courtney,

This would be a prerrecorded message with Dr Fauci solo, He would set up Avi’s award and help to
celebrate his Webby moment for him. Avi will be sending us his 5 word Webby speech which will then
follow Dr. Fauci's intro. Below is a draft of the introduction for him, let us know if he would like to make
any edits/changes. I’ve also attached the format for taping on hIs phone/computer. Please let me know
if you need any additional information and hoping we can make it work.

Thank you so much

DR. FAUCI:

I’m Dr. Anthony Fauci. Unfortunately, you‘ve seen a lot of me lately. Butthankfully, I’m here to present
some good news and I’m excited for the opportunity to shine some light on one of the many young
people who have stepped up and helped us throughout a difficult time.

The 211th Annual Webby Awards would like to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Person of the Vearto
recognize his creation of ncov2019.live to track the spread of COV|D719 across the world.

As we collectively navigate the severe impact of COVID-19, including the difficult, but critical calls for
nationwide social distancing, the Internet has become the lifeblood of people looking for accurate
information about the novel coronavtrus and the necessary steps to combat IL

Since launching the site on December 29th, Schiffmann’s tracking tool has been an invaluable resource
that sounded the alarm on the virus and its spread, notably calling attention to its severity long before
many global officials.

At a time when the spread of misinformation can be so detrimental to our efforts, the site has provided
over 600 million visitors with accurate realitime data. Schiffmann has helped people around the globe
understand COVlD-19 and the necessity of upgrades to current health care systems and the importance
of measures to flatten the curve.

For having the foresight to track the global spread of COVID-19 and for creating an essential website to

provide real-time data about the virus to people everywhere, it is my great privilege to honor Avi
Schiffmann as the 2020 Webby Person ofthe Year.

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I hope you and thefamily are all safe and healthy during these
challenging times. Hailed by The New Vork Times as ”the
Internet's highest honor,” The Webbv Awards has been the
premiere award for online excellence for over two decades,
honoring the companies and people who have critically shaped
digital technology and culture.

This year, due to the impact of the coronavirus The Webby
Awards are moving their renowned award show to an online
experience. On May 19th, 2020, the 24th Annual Webby Awards
will bring togetherWebby Winners from around the world in an
Internet Celebration which will showcase the artists,

NIH Production to ICAN_002707

organizations, and creators using their platforms to imagine a
better tomorrow through information. education. movement,
comedy, all while inspiring audiences to take action to enact
positive change.

The 24th Annual Webby Awards are proud to honor Avi
Schiffrnann as the 2020 Person of the Vear to recognize his
creation of ncov2019Jive to track the spread of COVlDdQ
across the world. We would be honored if Dr. Fauci would
"virtuallY’ present Avi with his award.

As we collectively navigate the severe impact of COVlD-19 on
the world and late calls for nation-wide social distancing, the
Internet has become the lifeblood for people looking for
accurate information about the novel coronavirus. Since
launching the site on December 29th, Avi Schiﬂmann’s
tracking site was a necessary tool that sounded the alarm on
the novel coronavirus and its spread, notably calling attention
to its severity long before many global officials. By providing
over 100 million visitors with real-time data on the virus'
spread, Schiffmann has helped people around the globe
understand COVID-19 and the necessitv of upgrades to current
health care systems and measures to flatten the curve.

For having the foresight to track the global spread of COVlD-19
and for creating a website to provide real-time data about the
virus to people everywhere, It is our great privilege to honor
Avi Schiﬂmann as the 2020 Webby Person of the Year. The
celebration will highlight the important work Avi and his
fellow winners are doing, and will mark his hallmark Webby 5-
Word acceptance speech in Internet history. Dr. Fauci's
presenter speech could be recorded on his phone and we can
send you through a script for him to review, edit and details
for format and deadline.

1 his year’s Webby Awards will also take action. the Impact of
COV|D719 and government responses around the world, has
brought the importance of voting into sharp focus. The Webby
Awards has partnered with Vote.or and aim to check the voter
registration status of 1 million voters in the United States,
promoting the importance of voting to help ensure voter
turnout this November is the highest it has ever been, This
partnership will integrate into all elements of this year’s online
celebration.

Our thoughts are with all of you in this difficult time.

Dear — highly respected — Dr. Fauci

Why do I try to childishly support a respected expert and personally
highly honored Gentleman like you— Dr. Fauxi ?

Because for me — it is heartbreaking and unbelievably disturbing, what
was and is going on in the course of the last 4 months in the USA.

I talk about the USA, that relieved my country - AUSTRIA - 75 years
ago from the hell of the NAZI-Regime — with American Lifes and
Blood.

With all my respect, my hopes, my passion, my tears, my mourning —
May Grace and Blessing be with You and the USA.

 

 

After running the numbers available on COVID 19 pandemic data — my
experiences as an Economist led to following analysis and proposed
strategy:

COVID 19 is a true threat for humans >65 years of age with pre-

Dr. Fauci,

I hope this email ﬁnds you well, I am a professor at the University
ofMaryland, an elected term member in the Council on Foreign
Relations, and a former fellow at the Supreme Court ofthe United
States.

I am writing because I am preparing a book, tentatively entitled
"Rebuilding America: A Blueprint for Post-COVID-l‘) America,"
consisting of essays by leading ﬁgures on (1) how COVID-l9 has
impacted their particular ﬁeld. and (2) how that ﬁeld should be
reimagined in light ofthe crisis, The essays will reconsider all
sectors of society, including law, education, healthcare, fashion,
music, etc., and collectively will be the ﬁrst comprehensive guide
for post-coronavirus reconstruction efforts.

1 am very hopeful that you may be willing to contribute a short essay
on how the current coronavirus has impacted public health policy, and
how such policies can and should evolve moving forward.

Only 50 industry leaders are being asked to contribute. Commitments
have been secured from an impressive group, including a retired
four-star general and a preeminent constitutional scholar, 1 very much
hope you will take part in this innovative prolect given your historic
and unparalleled contributions to the public's understanding of the
current crisis,

With respect to logistics, I am hoping to receive commitments from all
authors this month, with essays due within one month, and with the

NIH Production to ICAN_002719

essays available through Amazon’s expedited publishing platform
roughly one month after that. Each essay should be no more than 1,000
words, and I may offer light edits for the author's ﬁnal approval. A
ﬁnal note: all proceeds from the sale of the book will be donated,

I am very hopeful that you will give every serious consideration to
this invitation, and will lend your voice towards reimagining and
revitalizing a new America,

Dear Zhu,
The COVlD-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat not only to global public health but
also to economic and political stability. Uncertainty about the origin of COVID-19 pandemic is
causing friction worldwide, particularly between China and the United States, There is
agreement that the causative agent. SARS»CoV»2 originated in a bat. There is also a high level
of conﬁdence that the virus was n_otdeliberately modiﬁed in any laboratory. What we do not
know is the answers to two questions: (1) whether a precursor virus circulated in the human
population before it evolved to become a pandemic virus and 2 whethera recursor virus
ada led to humans b first assin throu h another animal.

Dear Doctors,

I don't know if you have got this infomation.

A truly deadly virus

cannot spread very far. Why? Because people quickly get sick and die. In
other words, they cannot spread the virus further, which is a prerequisite for
a large spread like corona. Covid-19 has spread throughout the world.

The premise is that it is not very dangerous, it causes mild symptoms for
most people, many do not even notice that they were sick. But the virus has
different phases in the body, after a while it goes into a resting phase, you
feel better, but the virus is still present and can pass on. Covid-19 is an
optimally developed virus that spreads rapidly around the world. But if it
were really deadly, almost everyone would die.

NIH Production to ICAN_002727

So far in our 4 billion long history, there have been no airborne viruses or
bacteria. Yes, in the hollywood movie "outbreak" there was, but it was a
movie. Why hasn‘t it?

If it had existed, this planet would have been a dead planet without life. It
would have killed all living. It is possible that there is somewhere else in the
universe, but not here on planet Earth. Not now. Remember, this is not the
first time a new virus is spreading in the world. What is happening now has
happened earlier in our long history.

But people are die you say. Yes, but the virus don‘t kill them. The virus open
a "door" in the cell wall thats allows for bacterias, how always are present,
to invade the body and create an aggressiv bacterial superinfection. That's
what kills them. See,

Disease.

How can this happen? How can the doctors be so blind. I have a theory
about this and here it comes:

My W" was a psychologist. May she rest in peace in heaven.

It seems that the corona virus has affected the brain more in a certain group
in society, namely politicians, doctors, journalists and other with power and
positions in the society. The virus is not dangerous for this group, but it's
opens a door in the brain's cell wall that allows it to enter the fear center of
the brain.

This door has been closed for many years. We haven't had any major wars
and nothing has threatened them. They have felt invulnerable. Convinced of
their own superior ability and greatness. Not only can they control the
people, they can now control the climate by turning the carbon dioxide tap.
If they close it, the temperature drops, if they open it the temperature goes
up. They don't know that the sun is 109 times as big as our planet. 109
times. It seams so small when we look up in the sky. They thought they
could control everything.

Then came the VIRUS, they receive an abrupt awakening. They get
scared. Politicans get sick and die. Doctors die. The brain is attacked by fear
virus. They can no longer think clearly and logically. The panic is near, they
are reminded of their own mortality. Just like a virus in a computer. It's
slows it down and it becomes unusable. Thats whats happen when a fear
virus attacks the brain.

Here where I live, there are panic over 1600 confirmed cases. The televison
is talking "infected persons" when there is "confirmed laboratory cases". It‘s
two different things. Misleading the people. Why panic over 1 600 infected?
Closing all not nessecary buissness, all schools, all except for supermarket,
gas station, banks. You can't go out after 5.00 pm. If you do, you get
arrested.

NIH Production to ICAN_002730

Why? They are scared. Because the ruling class is afraid. Everyone with
this masks. Doctors crying on television. The President with mask. They are
scared. Doctors. Journalists. Polices.

2020. The year when the world got completely crazy.

You have an medical obligation to inform the world about
the truth.

Dear Colleagues,

As you may be aware, the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-
private partnership has been moving forward rapidlyto address the global pandemic. We held our
initial ACTIV leadership meeting on April 3"I including, NIH, FDA, BARDA, EMA, and industry heads of
research and development. Four working groups were formed out of this meeting to focus on
preclinical therapeutics, clinical therapeutics, clinical trial capacity, and vaccines.

Although some le have representatives participating in the working groups, we recognize there is a
need to keep everyone looped in to the various activities and progress of the partnership, particularly in
view of all of the concurrent IC projects about COV|[}19. The ACTlV working groups will be delivering
their second report to the ACTIV Leadership Group on Wednesday, May 6, from 3:30-5:00pm. lam
writing to invite the lCDs to listen—in or this meeting. There will be a lot to cover during the meeting and
the members of the Leadership Group will be asking the questions. But to give a chance for us NIHers to

NIH Production to ICAN_002736

discuss what has been presented, I am scheduling a separate ICD call for 5:05-5:30pm, immediately
followrng the AClIV leadership meeting.

ll you are available to take part, please send your responses to David Wholley and Cheryl Melencio of

FNIH (cc'd here) by noun tomorrow, May 5'". Once you confirm your attendance, Cheryl will send you
a calendar invite for both the ACTIV leadership meeting and the ICD follow-up tall

we would certainly not want to do anything to slow you down! I understand that
you are evaluating several mRNA formats with BioNTech. If one of those turned
out to be ready for phase II/III in late June, we would be most interested in the
possibility of including that inthe master protocol. Please keep Tony and me in

We certainly enjoy taking part in ACTIV

I will check if we did get our drugs on the lists below

 

I will discuss w Kathrin lansen if we may have an option to add one of our several vaccine
formats that is less advanced or a reﬁned format of our most advanced in the master
protocol etc

If we can agree about shared key endpoints , we can include that cross all studies Whether

Hi Mikael,

Thanks for your note and this update on exciting progress on several
fronts. ACTlV is moving forwa rd with gratifying speed and
commitment. With regard to vaccines, tomorrow the ACTIV vaccines
WG will be discussing a master protocol for a phase ”II” trial with
adaptive design. multiple arms, and a shared placebo arm, aiming to
launch on or about July 1, FDA is strongly supportive, The Moderna,
Sanoﬁ, and in] vaccines are likely to be included — might Pﬁzer also

I hope you are having a good weekend,

Quick question: Would you be OK if I/we reached out to Joe
Menetski. who I understand leads many of the ACTIV efforts.
We have come to know Joe very well as a great collaborator on
the AMP gene therapy initiative and It would be very easy I
think working informally with Joe to look a bit more underthe
hood and identify/ map opportunities for alignment with the
other initiatives

All the Best.

Hi John, Cliff, and Tony,

See note below, where Mikael Dolsten indicates Pfizer is planning to—

am not quite sure what he means by “several vaccine formats".

Does this timetable sound realistic?
Any suggestion about a response?

Hi Francis
We certainly enjoy taking part in ACI'IV

I will check if we did get our drugs on the lists below

 

I will discuss w Kathrin Jansen if we may have an option to add one of our several vaccine formats that
is less advanced or a refined format ofour most advanced in the master protocol etc

If we can agree about shared key endpoints , we can include that cross all studies Whether master
protocol or more advanced sponsortrials which helps comparison

Happy to discuss w you and welcome your advice

Hl Mikael,

Thanks for your note and this update on exciting progress on several fronts. ACTIV
is moving forward with gratifying speed and commitment. With regard to vaccines,
tomorrow the ACTIV vaccines WG will be discussing a master protocol for a phase
“II” trial with adaptive design, multiple arms, and a shared placebo arm, aiming to
launch on or aboutJuly 1. FDA is strongly supportive. The Moderna, Sanoﬁ, and
mi vaccines are likely to be included — might Pfizer also join?

Francis,

I hope you are having a good weekend.

Quick question: would you be OK if i/we reached out to Joe Menelski, who I
understand leads many of the ACiIV efforts. We have come to know Joe very
well as a great collaborator on the AMP gene therapy initiative and It would

be very easy I think working informally with Joe to look a bit more under the
hood and identify/ map opportunities for alignment with the other initiatives.

All the Best,
Morten

A voice from the past. Covide19 prevented us from meeting up—but I’m writing

because it might yet bring at least the two of us together.

_Samsung’s venture capital group and his team has what I think is an incredibly useful idea
for contact tracing for covid»19 as well as actually opening the economy up again. The idea is contained
within the attachment.

Iwonder if you still have any contacts with Anthony Fauci. Is so, could you see your way clear to
forwarding the attachment to him? The group has identified some appropriate test manufacturers but
is at the point where they need to know the spectrum so as to focus on the optimal ones. The thought

was that Tony Fauci might be the best person to know what tests are in development stage.

Dear Dr, Fauci,

I hope you and the family are all safe and healthy during these challenging times Hailed
by The New York Times as ”the lnternet’s highest honor,” The Webby Awards has been the
premiere award for online excellence for over two decades. honoring the companies and
people who have critically shaped digital technology and culture

This year, due to the impact of the coronavirus The Webby Awards are moving their
renowned award show to an orilille experience. Orr May 19th, 2020, the 24th Annual
Webby Awards will bring together Webby Winners from around the world in an lnternet
Celebration which will showcase the artists, organizations, and creators using their
platforms to imagine a better tomorrow through information, education, movement,
comedy, all while inspiring audiences to take action to enact positive change.

The 14th Annual Webby Awards are proud to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 1020 Person
of the Vear to recognize his creation of ncov2019.live to track the spread of COVlD-19
across the world. We would be honored if Dr. fauci would "virtually" present Avi with
his award.

As we collectively navigate the severe impact of CDVlD-19 on the world and late calls for
nation-wide social distancing, the lnternet has become the lifeblood for people looking
for accurate information about the novel coronavirus. Since launching the site on
December 29th, Avi Schiffmann’s tracking site was a necessary tool that sounded the
alarm on the novel coronavirus and its spread, notably calling attention to its severity
long before many global officials. By providing over 100 million visitors with real-time
data on the virus‘ spread, Schiffmann has helped people around the globe understand
COVID-19 and the necessity of upgrades to current health care systems and measures to
flatten the curve.

For having the foresight to track the global spread of COVID-19 and for creating a
website to provide real-time data about the virus to people everywhere, it is our great
privilege to honor Avi Schiffmann as the 2020 Webby Person of the Vear. The
celebration will highlight the important work Avi and his fellow winners are doing, and
will mark his hallmark Webby 5-Word acceptance speech in Internet history. Dr. Fauci's
presenter speech could be recorded on his phone and we can send you through a script
for him to review, edit and details for format and deadline.

This year’s Webby Awards will also take action, the impact of COVID-19 and government
responses around the world, has brought the importance of voting into sharp focus. The

NIH Production to ICAN_002764

Webby Awards has partnered with Vote.or and aim to check the voter registration status
of 1 million voters in the United States. promoting the importance of voting to help ensure
voter turnout this November is the highest it has ever been. This partnership will integrate
into all elements of this year's online celebration.

Our thoughts are with all of you in this difficult time‘

you are doing to manage it.

A voice from the past. Covid-IQ prevented us from meeting up but I'm writing
because it might yet bring at least the two of us together.

00(5) Samsung‘s venture capital group and histeam has what I think is an incredibly useful idea
for contact tracing for covid-19 as well as actually opening the economy up again. The idea is contained
within the attachment.

I wonder if you still have any contacts with Anthony Fauci. Is so, could you see your wayclearto
forwarding the attachment to him? The group has identified some appropriate test manufacturers but
is at the point where they need to know the spectrum so as to focus on the optimal ones. The thought
was that Tony Fauci might be the best aerson to know what tests are in development stage.

What are your thoughts?

Don't worry about confidentiality; they want to Widely share this idea so as to get it out as quickly as
possible.

Dr. Fauci- Of course, i appreciate how busy you are, sojust reaching out again on behalf
of the American College of Cardiology as noted below We were hopeful we could steal
just an hour of your time in Junefor an important discussion on COV|D719 and exercise
training. This is part of a virtual agenda for one of our national conferences (Care of the
Athletic Heart) with outreach around the world given this is a part of the ACC
educational platform

We hope this is something you have the bandwidth for, and simply appreciate your
consideration. I hope to hear from you and thank you for all your service once again.

Dr. Fauci»

On behalf ofthe American College of Cardiology (ACC), first 1 would like to thank you for your
tremendous service throughout your incredible career and certainly during these present and
challenging times. We are indebted to your service and thankful everyday we have you to help
guide public health measures through the COVID»19 pandemic.

I am a member of the Sports and Exercise Council for the ACC and the Course Chair for our
annual ACC Care of the Athletic Heart Conference. Originally scheduled June 18-20, 2020 at ACC
Heart House in Washington DC. lam also faculty at Emory University and direct our sports
cardiology program in Atlanta.

Of course, we have made the difficult decision to cancel our live meeting in June, but myself
along with the staff at ACC are working very hard transitioning the course to a virtual course
and agenda. This course will be a much shorter version and the agenda will all be pre-recorded
and distributed as a ‘live simulated version' on June 20, 2020.

With the impact of COVlD-19 on all aspects of life and society, in our academic world of sports
cardiology, we are dealing with how COVID has Impacted exercise and athletes. As you can
imagine, there are a multitude of different issues and questions that colleagues are raising,

One new session for our virtual agenda that we think will generate a lot of interest and is of
high importance will be a panel discussion on sports, exercise, and COVID-19. We would like to
get additional expertise on the panel from the ID/public health and Sports Medicine arenas, in
addition to sports cardiology. Of course, there is no one that carries the expertise you do from
the ID and public health perspective and we would be extremely honored if you could be a part
of this one session and join our facthy for the course.

Before getting into more details and a formal invite from the ACC, I wanted to first see if you
had the bandwidth for this. Understanding you are as busy, if not busier, than anyone in the
world right now. This session would be ore-recorded and we would certainly work to be flexible
with anytime you had forthis in early June to record.

I hope this is something that could work— again we would be honored to host you virtually.

Many thanks for considering, and hope to hear from you soon. Best, Jonathan Kim

Dear Dr. Fauci,

I hope to find you well with this email.

I take the liberty to write you because I have some concern about the misinformation

that can discredit yourtask and honors.

On many occasions in tv and press, Antonio Giordano. Director of Sbarro Institute in Philadelphia,
Keeps saying that he is a member of the USATask Force.

I'm wondering if it’strue.

Currently I’m a research fellow at University of Sussex.

I apologize if you find this email inopportune, the time is unfortunate, I grant you.
ldon’t like the idea that some people might take advantage of this very unpleasant moment for all the world.
So I wish that I made a mistake this time.

I’m also wondering if you are willing to release a brief interview.

Tony,

YTD spending is $67.5M, unchanged“ from last week. A summary is attached.

I have also attached an updated budget plan reflecting our projected spending by research category by
fiscal year. We are updating this weekly as we receive updates from the divisions on the timing of
clinical trials, observational studies, natural history studies and research resource needs.

We will report mid-week on our YTD spending which will be in sync with the data the Dept. extracts.

Martin

 

 

o The reason that we have reported no weekly increase is to match our reported spending with the
financial information that the Department is now extracting from our accounting system. We have
always included spending from our regularappropriation, as directed by the Department. Now the
guidance from the Dept. has been updated to report o_n|y_spending from the supplemental COVID-
19 appropriations.

YTD spending is $67.5M , a weekly increase of $45.9M mostly for initial funding for set—up of
clinical trials for evaluation of remdesivir in patients with early disease stage and a placebo-
contrclled clinical trial of intravenous hyper-immune immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with
COVID-l9.

I’ve provided a summary spending plan the team worked on and a table for the $1,532B that we
have received in supplemental appropriations

YTD spending is $21i6M , a weekly increase of $4.0M for clinical trial site set-up for
therapeutics, further vaccine development, small animal development, and therapeutic
development (mAhs) and basic research.

Most of the $50M-$60M we listed last week we expect to be awarded before March 31. In many
cases contractors have begun work without the award so as to not stall work,

Early next week I‘ll provide a summary spending plan for the additional $706M that NIAID
received in the supplemental appropriation signed by the President today.

Zeke:

I did not ”strongly” endorse it. I specifically said that it was not a knockout drug
and was only a baby step in the direction of developing more and better drugs. I
said that it was important because it proved in a well-powered, randomized,
placebo—controlled clinical trial that one can suppress the virus enough to see a
clinical effect. as modest as the effect was. I do not think I forced anything.

Happy to chat with you about it.

lam a bit perplexed by your seeming strong endorsement of rerndesivir. Was it just a bit

My reading was the data were weak and in normal times for normal disease it is not enough to
to approve. And very unlikely to really impact COVID-19 disease pattern->regardless of supply

Thank you for you note, We will know soon whether hydroxychloroquine has
any beneficial effects as the results of randomized, controlled trials become
available The pathogenesis of COVlD-19 is still an open question. You are correct
in that there is a more recent tendency to use ventilators only as a very last resort
since oxygenation rather than ventilation appears to be key to recovery.

Subject: Coronavirus: Covicl 19

Hi Dr Fauci,

Please find an audio attached of a doctor describing the experience with regards to covid 19 in the
hospital. She seems to suggest covid 19 is a virus that rather attacks the blood cell, leading to respiratory
and other organ complications, hence they need to loom at treatment in a different light. In the UK
some hospitals have moved away from using ventilators due to the high death rate of those on
ventilators, and are rather using ventilators for sleep apnea, as they are less invasive, and the results are
much much better compared to invasive ventilators

There are some anecdotal observations I have also made. The infection rate in most African countries

seem to be comparatively low, which could possibly due to the rate of testing being conducted.
However the death rates are also comparatively very low. From initial information with regards to

NIH Production to ICAN_002838

hydroxychloroquine and some antimalaria drugs usage. it was suggested that those who were alleged
to have had some benefits had mild symptoms of covid 19. I know some clinical trials have shown
hydroxychloroquine not to be effective in the treatment of covrd 19 in very ill patients. However, my
hypothesis is. are the low death rates in Africa linked to the fact that malaria is very prevelant in Africa.
and lots of Africans take antimalarial drugs, making them less susceptible to covid 19, hence the low
death rate. Is there a similartrend in other countries where malaria is prevalent? Is there an unintended
benefit of taking antimalarial drug (or other medication) before covid infection, or at the onset, making
people less susceptible to covid19‘

As I said, this is based on anecdotal observations.

Vours sincerely
Ato Stephens

Thanks for the heads up. Is there any more detailed description of the precise
clinical manifestations? They describe a l‘multisystem inflammatory state”. It is
vasculitis or anything more specific? Could be an infectious agent that has
nothing to do with SARSvCoV~2 infection even though some children are
circumstantially infected with SARS-CoV—Zor it could be a post-SARS—CoV—Z
inflammatory syndrome, perhaps a Kawasaki syndrome—like disease. Please keep

Fauci says leak concerns fueled his White
House revelation of Gilead drug results

Julie Steenhuysen
5 Min Read

CHICAGO (Reuters) — Concerns over leaks compelled the top U.S. infectious disease official to reveal data
on Gilead Sciences Inc’s experimental drug remdesiVlr. the first in a scientifically rigorous clinical trial to
Show benefit in treating COVlD-lQ,

NIH Production to ICAN_002871

 

National institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Faiici attends a coronavirus
response meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Louisiana Governorlohn Bel Edwards in
the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 29, 2020. REUTERS/Carlos Barria

The dramatic announcement by Dr Anthony Fauci in the Oval Office on Wednesday prompted concerns
among scientists that theTrump administration was raising hopes about a coronavirus treatment before
sharing the full data with researchers.

As a cautionary example of inflating the potential value ofa therapy, some pointed to President Donald
Trump's repeated endorsements of malaria drug hvdroxychloroquine as a treatment, with no evidence
that it works.

Newerdata suggests the malaria treatments may carrysignificant risks for some sufferers ofthe
respiratory disease caused by the virus.

Fauci, director ofthe National institute of Allergy and infectious Diseases lNIAID), which is running the
trial. said he tookthe first opportunity to get the word out that patients taking a dummy treatment or
placebo should be swnched to remdesivn in hopes of benefiting from it.

He expressed concern that leaks of partial information would lead to confusion, Since the White House
was not planning a daily virus briefing. Fauci said he was invited to release the news at a news
conference with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwardle). “It was purely driven by ethical concerns," Fauci
told Reuters in a telephone interview.

”i would love to wait to present it at a scientific meeting. but it'sjust not in the cardswhen you have a
situation where the ethical concern about getting the drug to people on placebo dominates the
conversation."

An independent data safetyand monitoring board, which had looked at the preliminary results of the
NIAlD trial, determined it had met its primary goal of reducing hospital stays

On Tuesday evenlng, that information was conveyed in a conference call to scientlsts studying the drug
globally.

"There are Ilterally dozens and dozens of investigators around the world,” Faucl said. "People were
starting to leak it.” But he did not give details of where the unreported data was being shared

Several scientists interviewed by Reuters felt the White House setting seemed inappropriate for the
release of highly anticipated government-funded trial data on the Gilead therapy.

They had expected it to be presented simultaneously in a detailed news release, a briefing at a medical
meeting or in a scientific journal, allowing researchers to review the data.

Information from varioustrials of remdeslvir has been leaked to media in recent weeks In a statement
on Wednesday, Gilead sald the NIAID’s much anticipated trial had met lts primarygoal, but gave no
details.

Data in a separate NIAID statement after Fauci spoke detailed preliminary results showingthat patients
who got the drug had a 31 percent fastertime to recovery than those who got a placebo, cutting
hospital stays by four days

The trial also came close to showing the drug helped people survive the disease, but the data tell just
short of statistlcal significa nce.

"i want to see the full data. I want to understand the statistics. I want to understand the benefit and risk.
Iwarlt to understand the structure of the study, and all of it," said Dr. Steven Nisserl, tlle chief academic
officer at the Cleveland Clinic.

"Am I encouraged from what I've heard? Yes, I’m encouraged. But I want to get a full understanding of
what happened here, and not get it via a photo opportunity from the Oval Office."

Data Gilead released on its own trial of remdesivir drew less attention, as it did not compare outcomes
between those receiving therapy and those who did not.

Results from a third study in China suggesting remdesivir failed to help COVlD719 patients were released
in the British medical journal the Lancet after review by a peer group of scientists.

"That's the only thing I'll hang my hat on, and that was negative," said Dr. Eric Topol, director and
founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.

He was unimpressed by remdesivir’s modest benefit.

"it was expected to be a whopping effect,” Topol added. “It clearly does not have that."

At the Oval Office news conference, Fauci compared the study findings to AZT, the first drug to show any
benefit against HIV, decades ago.

“We know that was an imperfect drug. It was the first step,” Fauci said in the inten/iew,

"Similar to AZT, it‘s lremdeslvir) the first baby step towards what hopefully will be a number of better
drugs that will come in and be able to treat people with COVIDA19.”

Dear Dr. Pape:

I lead the World Health Organization (WHO) delegation to the United Nations and know of you through

Tony Fauci and Henry Masur,—. For nearly 5 years immediately

preceding my appointment at WHO., I was an technical advisor at Hopital Sacré7Coeur in Milot and
remain in close contact with institution. Because ofthis, PAHO leadership asked me to join their COVID-
19 planning discussions related to Haiti. i understand from Henry that you have been appointed by
MSPP to coordinate COVID-19 preparedness and response activities, If you have some time available on
Friday, it would be good to talk via Zoom or Webex. I can arrange this and would plan to have the
PAHO deputy director as well as other PAHO officials on the line. Would you be available Friday
afternoon for such a discussion? If not Friday, anytime overthe weekend would also likely work on our
end.

Thanks so much for considering this
With best regards,

Subject: NAD repletion for Covid-19
Importance: High

Dear Dr. Fauci,

Recent research has shown that SARS~CoV~Z plays havoc with NAD function within cells.

Coronavirus Infection and PARP Expression Dysregulate the NAD Metabolome: A Potentially Actionable
Component of Innate Immunity:

https://www.biorxivorg/content/lo.1101/2020.04.17.047A80v3

The Molecular Story of COVID»19; NAD+ Depletion Addresses All Questions in this Infection:
https://www.preprints.org/manuscripr/202003.0346/v1

 

Other research has shown that NAD+ levels decline from aging and obesity, both significant factors in
Covid-19 severity. But it has also beendemonstrated that NAD levels can be replenished through oral
administration of nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NR in particular
has had several human studies demonstrating its safety and efficacy, and roughly 50 human studies
listed on clinicaltrialsgov for all manner of disorders.

There is at least one anecdotal report of dramatic improvement in a Covid719 patient after

NIH Production to ICAN_002876

administration of NMN,

NMN shows great promise in case studies of humans with COVID-19:

bWROWFoifQ%3D%3D

That article begins with the disclaimer, "There are no human trials that prove effectiveness [If any NAD+
boosting supplements for preventing or curing COVID—19."

That is a problem. when I see the resources that have been wasted pursuing hydroxychloroquine. lam
saddened to learn that there are no clinical trials of nicotinamide riboside as part of a treatment
regimen for Covid-19. Can you do anything about getting such a study done?

Regards,
Mel Cohen

To add to the debt...)osh and Iwanted to see ifyou would be willing to join a call with Business
Roundtable CEOs. We have been doing COVlD-19 calls with them every Friday at 1:30pm Typically.
about 100-125 CEOS of large, U.Si-based firms will join. They are all managing and planning for difficult
issues around employee and customersafetv, They would love to hearfrom you directly and to ask a
few questions, It might also be a good place to deliver any messages you want them to hear.

We completely understand if it isn’t doable. ofcourse, If you are able, we would love to host you
sometime between 1:30pm-2:30pm this Friday (or any Friday on which your schedule would allow it).

ALSO: Bill Hall called me to ask if you had alerted the Secretary to this (so the press release clearance
process isn’t the way he first learns of it). I told him I wasn't sure. If you haven’t done so, perhaps you
wish to now?

 

As part of the US, Food and Drug Administration’s commitment to expediting the development
and availability of potential COVID-l9 treatments, the agency has been engaged in sustained and
ongoing discussions with Gilead Sciences regarding making remdesivir available to patients as
quickly as possible, as appropriate.

GILEAD SCIENCES STATEMENT ON POSITIVE DATA EMERGING
FROM NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS
DISEASES’ STUDY OF REMDESIVIR

Foster City, Calif., April 29, 2020 7 Gilead Sciences. Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) is aware
of the positive data emerging from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Discascs’ (NIAID) study of rcmdcsivirr We understand that the trial has met its
primary endpoint and that NIAID will provide detailed information at an upcoming
brieﬁng.

In addition to the NIAID trial, Gilead expects to share additional remdesivir data
from the company's open-label Phase 3 SIMPLE trial in patients with severe COVID-
19 disease shortly. This study will provide inlumiatiun on whether a shorter, 5-day
duration of therapy may have similar efﬁcacy and safety as the 10-day treatment
course evaluated in the NIAID trial and other ongoing trials. Gilead expects data at
the end of May from the second SIMPLE study evaluating the 5- and 10-day dosing
durations of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 disease.

NIH Production to ICAN_002883

Gilead will continue to discuss with regulatory authorities the growing data set
regarding remdesivir as a potential treatment for COVID- l9.

Older adults with COVlD-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, have several "atypical" symptoms,
complicating efforts to ensure they get timely and appropriate treatment, according to physicians.
COVID»19 is typically signaled by three symptoms: a fever, an insistent cough and shortness of breath.
But older adults — the age group most at risk of severe complications or death from this condition —
may have none of these characteristics.

Instead, seniors may seem "off" — notacting like themselves — early on after being infected by the
coronavirus. They may sleep more than usual or stop eating. They may seem unusually apathetic or
confused, losing orientation to their surroundings They may become dizzy and fall. Sometimes, seniors
stop speaking or simply collapse.

Subject: HIGH SCHOOL MUN CONFERENCE
Dear Dr. Anthony Fauci,

My name is Dane Cohn, and lam an 00(5),. I have often
listened to your inspiring words on the news and followed your assiduous work to help
us through this pandemic, Our school participates in Model UN, an event in which high
school students represent various countries in debates on international issues from the
past and present. Colorado’s final Model UN conference was canceled, so our school

( 00(5)) decided to host an online conference for the whole state
of Colorado and beyond. Our team would like to formally invite you to give a short
address (be it pre-recorded or live online) to the students during our opening

ceremony.

We hope that our conference will inspire the youth of our nation and the world to stand
up and fight for our future rather than resign their aspirations to lockdown. We host this
conference because we see the importance of keeping our academic passions going
while staying safe within the conﬁnes of our homes. We host this conference because
we want to contribute to the fight against COVID-19 — money raised from our
conference will go towards buying masks, food, and other resources for those who need
it most.

This is why we ask you, a hero during this troubling time, to speak to the students of our
conference. who not only include the youth of Colorado, but also the youth of our
country and world. Any type of address would be greatly and wholeheartedly
appreciated. If your address is pie-recorded, we would appreciate it if we could receive
it by May 1st, as our conference is the morning of May 2nd. We believe you can bring
true inspiration into our hearts and minds. We know you are very busy, but if it were at
all possible to share with us even a short 2-3 minute pre-recorded greeting and
message to the students participating in this Model UN conference, it would be truly
inspirational. Thank you so much for yourtime, we hope to hear from you soon.

Most Respectfully,
Dane Cohn and the entire 00(5) Model UN Team

Hi Adrienne,

I hope you’re doing well.

I'm reaching out because Chair
DeLauro would like to invite Dr. Fauci
to a hearing next Wednesday, May 6,
with the House LHHS appropriations
subcommittee. The focus ofthe
hearing, not surprisingly, would be
COVD-19. Members of the
subcommittee would very much like
to hear from Dr. Fauci on anything
related to COVID-19, but I think the
maintopics would be:

NIH Production to ICAN_002901

- Mitigation and Testing; and

0 Progress on vaccines,
therapeutics, and
diagnostics, as well as
necessary preparations to
manufacture and
disseminate a vaccine once it
is ready.

Chair DeLauro is flexible about a
starting time for the hearing on
Wednesday. so she would be happy
to accommodate a time that works
for Dri Fauci's schedule.

Please let me know as soon as
possible, so we can plan accordingly.

Thanks so much,

Stephen

This is Anthony rim, immediate former us Transportation Secretary, mi I greatly enjoyed our internettens (brief
thoughts they were) during my time in the Inst Administration.

I write to request your help in advtsing the transportation community about how to manage through the present
crisis‘ particularly as some areas are casing restrictions. I would welcome an opportunity to join you in a Q/A‘ which
could be valuable for ridcshare companies (5X0), transit agencies. airlines etc I would
think that a 10-15 minute chat would do wonders. That said, I know you are terribly busy and have so many things
to do but would appreciate any opportunity to help you get important information out.

This could be pulled together rapidly and done within the next week or so

Thanks for your attention to this matter. Al my best.

Subject: e: Covid thrombi
Dear Tony,

Italked with Dr. Viecca this morning who shared additional information about his protocol. They started
from the pathological observation that all patients dying of Covid-19 pneumonia had diffuse pulmonary
microthrombosis. Since they detected almost exclusively white thrombi, they reasoned that they had to
block platelet activation/aggregation, while heparin would be ineffective at that stage. Thus, they
treated a first group of five critical patients with potent anti-aggregant therapy (Tirofiban/Aggrastat) and
apparently in all of them the p02 started to rise within less than 2 hours, they got off the ventilators and
went on to full recovery. Viecca is an interventional cardiologist—

— I sent copy of his protocol and contact information to Joe.

Let me know ifl can be of any further help. All the best,

Paolo

Tony,

Please see below and attached a time-sensitive COVID—19 Item foryour awareness and sharing with the
remainder of the Task Force, as appropriate. The plan is to release this tomorrow.

Item 1: Title: Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) Initiative

Activity Type: Funding of new research program

Summag: With 3 00(5) investment from federal stimulus funding, RADx initiative will infuse
funding into early innovation technologies to speed development of rapid and widely accessible
COVlD~19 testing. At the same time, NIH will seek opportunities to move more advanced
diagnostic technologies swiftly through the development pipeline toward commercialization and
broad availability. As part ofthe initiative, NIH is urging scientists and inventors with a rapid
testing technology to compete in a national COV|D~19 testing challenge for a share of up to $500
million over all phases for further development. The goal is to add tens of millions per month of
accurate and easyetoVuse tests to all Americans by Fall 2020.

Impact on COVID-19 Pandemic Response: RADx will accelerate the development, validation, and
commercialization of innovative new testing methods that can be deployed in pointAof~care and
home settings. These technologies are urgently needed to guide and inform safe return to work,
school, and life activities.

Hi Dr. Fauci,

Please find attached for your review a draft release about the launch of the Human
Epidemiology and Response to SARS—CoV-Z (HEROS) study, which Is Intended to help determine
the percentage ofchildren infected with SARS»COV»2 and the percentage of infected children
who develop COVID. In addition, the study will examine whether rates of SARS-CoV-Z infection
differ between children who have asthma or other allergic conditions and children who do not.
Your draft quote is as follows:

"One interesting feature of this novel coronavirus pandemic is that very few children
have become sick with COVID-19 compared to adults,” said NIAID Director AnthonyS. Fauci,

M.D. ”lsthis because children are resistant to infection with SARS’COVaz, or because they are

and other key questions,”

Topic: Statement by ASF during Saturday NAS web briefing
Deadline: urgent

HI Pattyr

Elizabeth would like to clarify something that Dr. Fauci apparently said about remdesivir
during his NAS web briefing on Saturday. The transcribed segment of the talk that she is
focused on says

”Remdesivir is the one that’s gotten the most publicity. it is interesting that if you look otit
in a prophylactic therapeutic model in MERS coronavirus infection, it looked pretty good
There was clinical beneﬁts just reported a couple of weeks ago ofSARS coronavirus 2 in
rhesus macaques."

She wants to Llarify what Dr. quLi meant by looking at ierndesivir “in a pruphylaLliL
therapeutic model in MERS"—whether this means in an animal model or something else. It
sounds like that phrase is referring to the RML study in which remdesivir successfully
prevented disease in MERS~infected rhesus macaques, as reported in the Feb. 13 NlAID
media availability pasted below. Is that correct?

Best,
Laura

Romdcsivir Prevents MERS Coronavirus Disease in Monkeys

Results Support Testing Antiviral Against 2019 Novel Caronavirus

February 13. 2020

The experimental antiviral remdesivirsuccessfully prevented disease in rhesus macaques
infected With Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSeCoV), according to a
new study from National Institutes of Health scientists. Remdesivir prevented disease
when administered before infection and improved the condition ofmacaques when given
after the animals already were infected.

the new report from NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
appears in the Proceedings of the Mariano/Academy of Sciences.

MERS-COV is closely related to the 2019 novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-Z, previously known
as 2019-nCoV) that has grown to be a global public health emergency since cases were first
detected in Wuhan, China, in December.

Remdesivir has previously protected animals against a variety ofviruses in lab
experiments. The drug has been shown experimentally to effectively treat monkeys
intected With Ebola and Nipah viruses. Remdesivir also has been investigated as a
treatment for Ebola virus disease in people.

The current study was conducted at NIAID’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton,
Montana. The work involved three groups of animals: those treated with remdesivir 24

NIH Production to ICAN_002929

hours before infection with MERS-CoV; those treated 12 hours after infection (close to the
peaktime tor MERS»CoV replication In these animals); and untreated control animals.

The scientists observed the animals for six days. All control animals showed signs of
respiratory disease. Animals treated before infection fared well: no signs of respiratory
disease, signiﬁcantly lower levels of virus replication in the lungs compared to control
animals, and no lung damage Animals treated after infection fared significantly better
than the control animals: disease was less severe than in control animals, their lungs had
lower levels of virus than the control animals, and the damage to the lungs was less
severe.

The scientists indicate that the promising study results support additional clinical trials of
remdesivirfor MERS-CoV and COVlD-19, the disease that SARS-CoV-Z causes, Several
clinical trials of remdesivir for COVID-19 are under way in China, and other patients with
comp-19 have received the drug under a compassionate use protocol.

The Biomedical Advanccd Research and Development Authority (BARDAl, part of the US.
Department of Health and Human Services, also provided support for this study. Gilead
Sciences, Inc., developed remdesiVir, also known as 655734, and collaborated in the
research.

MERS-CoV emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Through DecemberZOlS, the World Health
Organization had confirmed 2,499 MERS-CDV cases and 861 deaths (or about 1 in 3).
Because about one-third of MERS-Cov cases spread from infected people being treated in
healthcare settings, the scientists suggest that remdesivir could effectively prevent disease
in other patients, contacts of patients, and healthcare workers. They also note the drug
might help patients who are diagnosed with MERS ur COVlD-19 ifgiven soon after
symptoms sta rt,

airthe conversation during a global errployee all handsto our 23,000 employees and then we could
syndicate parts of it externally on our social channels

Thanks for any help in reaching Fauci’steam.

Thanks, Jeremy. I saw the report in the Post from Saturday. These children had
mostly respiratory disease and diarrhea. I will check with the docs at DC
Children’s Hospital about the presence of ”multisystem inflammatory state”. This
could just be the advanced stage of their disease compatible with advanced

Jeremy:

Thanks for the heads up. Is there any more detailed description of the precise
clinical manifestations? They describe a ”multisystem inflammatory state". It is
vasculitis or anything more specific? Could be an infectious agent that has
nothing to do with SARS-CoV-2 infection even though some children are
circumstantially infected with SARS-CoV—Zor it could be a post-SARS—CoV—Z
inflammatory syndrome, perhaps a Kawasaki syndrome»like disease. Please keep
me informed if you hear any further information.

COVZ , insights into its pathobiology, immunity and
development of a pan-CoV antiviral.

- Richard Hatchett will discuss the development ofnew vaccines
and treatments against C OVID- 19.

I Sanjay Gupta Will comment on the health system response to the
pandemic and challenges related to communication and public
engagement in responding to COVID— 19.

Subject: SNL review

OKAY, so here is something even better than having Brad Pitt portray me on
SNL. It is a recent review of Pitt’s performance in which the TV reviewer said :

“Kicking things off, the Oscar winner dropped jaws during the cold open with
his monologue about President Donald Trump's recent (and concerning)
comments about COVlD-19.

"Good evening, I'm Dr. Anthony Fauci," Pitt began his monologue and looked
nearly identical to the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.”

Subject: Appreciation

Dr. Fauci | just wanted to express my profound appreciation to you for your work during this COVID~19
pandemic. I especially appreciate how you have spent considerable time and capital reaching out to the
Black and brown communities. I saw exerts of your snapchat with Will Smith and saw nearly all of your
interview on the Breakfast Club. I regret I have to send an email to you re this matter But this is the
day we live in. Minority communities continue to be overlooked in crises and the impact of such crises
on their respective communities. For you to be intentional about keeping the minority communities in
the loop is commendable, especially since these communities will be absorbing the disproportionate
share of the sicknesses and deaths coming from COVlD-19.

Thanks for all of what your are doing In keeping the nation Informed. Thanks for Informing based on the
facts, data, and truth.

Take care and ”Cover your six."
